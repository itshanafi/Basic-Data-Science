It's not easy to find in Miri City such level of service. The floor manager (I supposed) would check up on our food to make sure it can be sent on time. Appreciate that effort.I had dinner here the first night I was there.Ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap, which I wish the Caesar sauce would be provided a bit more because the wrap is a bit dry to eat. However the combination of food in this works and it's really quite a healthy choice to order for a light dinner.I came here before and ordered this as well. It's just that good!The next morning I had the Egg Benedict, while my partner ordered the Chef's Breakfast with scrambled egg.The breakfast dishes looked really good (mouth-watering!), and the taste is just marvellous. I really loved how they had the scrambled egg done - it was just perfect. As for the bread in the dishes were just so soft (not soggy)- so good!

Me and my wife came to Miri for 3 weeks long holiday and we have visited this cafe 2 days ago, this is our first and last. The restaurant atmosphere was good, the food was excellent and we do enjoy some locals food. However the service was really bad. You can see the staffs were very rude and the do not even give a friendly smile especially those who can speak English well than the locals staffs. It took us more than 30mins to get them order from us. And another 10mins to get their attention to get the cutlery for us. Even they were so mad at us for asking additional services like getting the sauce refill . This kind of services is not what we expected from top listed restaurants. Once we finished our dinner we decided to move in to the bar for couple of beers. However we were forced to make the payment first even though we request to pay the bill together with the beer at the end of the night. The night did not end well when we tried to order beers inside the bar but NONE of the staffs were paying attention to us. We tried to call one of the local staffs but he seems like looked at us in a very angry expression and he even missed out our order after we waited for 20mins on the first round. Not to say second round we hardly even get any of their attention because there were so busy inside the bar and none of them came to serve us. We had to spend most of our time trying to get attention of the staffs than enjoying our cold beers. I can't deny the environment is good, but definitely not the services we are looking for. I hope the services can be improved to service customers better. Do hope the management can train their staffs to have better attitude when servicing customers and at least, put a smile on your face.

"CatB_99Aberdeen, United Kingdom",Perfect lunch spot,"Food is fantastic, as a veggie it can be tricky to eat in Miri as things you'd never expect have meat in them, but here vegetarian is understood and catered well for, they even checked with us when we ordered something we might not have realised had egg in it to ensure that was OK with us. A good range of lentil, chickpea, vegetable, paneer and potato dishes as well as your typical meat offerings.All the roti and naan are cooked fresh to order in front of you - veryskilful! Cutlery all comes in boiling water so you know it's clean and I've never had any tummy issues in 6 months of eating here on average twice a week. The setup looks fairly basic but fans keep it cool enough and hey, plastic chairs are easy to keep clean and survive the humid climate well.The staff are fantastic and patiently interpret my garbled efforts at Malay (they speak English but I insist on trying Malay, much to their amusement) we feel welcome every time we visit.My parents ate here several times whilst they visited us from the UK and absolutely loved it, they seemed particularly keen on the Chicken Masala and Tandori chicken, good quality meat and not as sticky and cloying sauce as you tend to get in the UK. They were also looked after fantastically by the staff.I've delayed writing a review because selfishly I still want to be able to get here, have a fab lunch for 3GBP pp and be back at work in less than an hour but it's really only fair to recognise them for such good food and service :-)Just for info I think they are closed Mondays.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 11 October 2013 ,Khan's Taj Restaurant

We enjoyed the Lao Sha Bao, sweet and sour roll and the cheung fun. We ordered kueh tiaw basah as well which was actually cooked like wat tan hor and that was quite good too. We were initially quite apprehensive about it being halal, meaning the cha siew bao has chicken filling instead of pork and they don't serve cha siew cheung fun. However we were pleasantly surprised how good the ""cha siew bao"" was. They refilled tea for free too. Overall it was a better experience than Lao Yang; at least the dimsum was warm. Definitely will come back here again with my family. One other thing was that most of the fried dimsum was not available as they finished selling them over the weekend!

It arrived very well presented however on attempting to eat it I discovered it was so drenched in bbq sauce that it was impossible to eat it with your hands, as the bottom half was soaked with sauce.

girl_in_bluMalaysia,Coffee shop popular even with the locals,"First time visit to Miri so decided on dinner here after reading tripadvisor reviews. A casual coffee shop serving a reasonable selection of local favourites. What started out initially in the 70s as a sate (grilled skewered meat) shop, expanded into one of Miri's local eatery. This is according to the plaque that hangs in the shop. The shop is opposite Imperial Shopping Centre. We came for dinner around half 7 and had the chicken sate which was served with a small plate of gravy. The sate meat is tender, and of medium slice thickness. It was seasoned adequately with strong hint of star anise. Pleasant, not overly spicy. The gravy is of acceptable consistency, not rich/thick and is not chilli hot. I had the nasi goreng kampung special. It does not have kangkung or anchovies like what I'm used to. It was seasoned with a sambal and lacked salt but this was acceptable for me. The rice was served with a fried egg(not bulls eye), 3 sticks of beef sate and slices of chicken. The chicken slices felt out of place and was very bland. My friend had Soto, and I was told that the soup lacked taste. We had carrot juice and sour sop juice which were both prepared well. We also had a teh Tarik which was not too sweet with a good tea strength. Overall, I would say that the food we had was average to good. I was happy because it would seem that they don't overdo it on seasoning, salt or sugar (based on what we had). They have nasi lemak all day, a range of noodle dishes and Western dishes too. There's a good choice of drinks to choose from too. Food ranges from less than RM10 to about RM15. My last comment would be on the attentive and efficient service we got.

The red snapper that we ordered, only half came (the underlining fillet was removed). It was impossible for me to verify what was billed since the attached bills where written in Chinese. The bill was 281.45 for 2 people only, which seems quite high and I know the explanation will be again the high cost of maintaining live seafood.

The last item was a small plate of Okra. The food was good except for the prawns which looked exceptionally huge when it arrived.... it was obvious that they stuck to their 500gm weight! We had a rude shock when we were presented with a bill of Rm178 for the small fish, prawns, okra, a bottle of beer, an orange juice and 2 glasses of warm water.

I was here because I was accompanied by Muslim friends and hence decided on this restaurant coz this was stated as ""No pork served"" online and also from the pamphlet I obtained at the airport.What was worth praising was the gazebo like arrangement so that we can sit far away from the main serving areas and to be consumed with our own food and business chat without disturbing other guests.If you are from Europe or countries with spending power, then the meal here will be considered cheap for seafood :DDownside - maybe we were sitting too far off and we just cannot get the waitresses attention!Have a great one!

My second daughter and I finally ended up ordering hot Milo but was keenly disappointed because it was watery and had no taste of Milo at all only a bit of sweetness. My eldest daughter's hotlink was quite dilute too. Maybe this is because the barista was a Jill of all trades because she took our orders, made the drinks , served us and was also the cashier. I ordered cheesy scrambled omelette while my two girls had Greek omelette and ham and cheese croissant. It all tasted ok but we just wished that our omelette and croissant could be served warm.When the bill came, it was RM48.00 so I gave RM50 but declined the RM2.00 for tips.

Asked for extra blanket and was given in time, but asked for extra towel, they never came. The room didn't have standard toiletries ready so I had to request and waited for them to come.Requested in room dining and it was provided without much hassle and the menu were quite good.On 16 Nov evening, we found that the room was still average clean. There were still minor debris on the floor, the ice box was not looked at with leftover food from previous customer. The pool's water was quite dirty too.Upon check out on 17 Nov, the frontline counter struggled when queried about GST ID. At last I got the information and settled the payment. Tax invoice was handed to me in an envelope without thanking me for my stay there.So clearly Marriott was not prepared for my booking, and maybe that day all staff in Marriott were in bad mood. I feel quite frustrated with their recent performance and I could see that they are already past their prime.

It's also not too noisy so your breakfast experience can be quite comfortable. We paid RM35.50 for a 3 person meal so it's much more expensive compared to an ordinary coffee shop.

Traveller_J0Malaysia,Disgraceful experience!! Rotten Food!!,"I really wish Tripadvisor had a minus rating scale for this place!! I went to Eastwood Valley for lunch with my family, and my first impression on appearance of the venue was 'wow'. However, looks really can, and in this instance, be deceiving. We decided to dine in the outside area near the reception, overlooking the golf course. My husband ordered Nasi Lamak, and says it was just ok. It arrived cold, and was bog standard packaged food. His daughter ordered chicken and chips, and Laksa which was ok, and I ordered Fish and Chips. When my food arrived it looked ok, except it was clearly out of date frozen packaged food. As I cut into the fish I realised from its toughness it was inedible. It was clearly very old stock. I sent back the food, and the waiter said the reason for old stock was people don't buy the fish and chips very often! Anyway, I re-ordered egg and chips. My family had now finished their meals, and I waited ages for such a simple alternative. When the food arrived I smelt a strange 'wiff'. The egg was totally rotten, and in my opinion, there is no way the 'chef' didn't smell the stench!! I returned the food, and asked to speak with chef. I was approached by a local man posing as the chef, who clearly had a problem with my request to speak with him. I spoke to him about the food, and we all found his reaction extremely rude and offensive as with his hands on his hips he tried to claim there was no problem with his food, and its freshness. I informed him that I was a food inspector in Europe, and he changed his attitude and said he would take note of my comments about stock rotation, and 'use by' dates on board (doubt it somehow). There is no excuse for this poor service, and in my professional opinion this food outlet should be closed down immediately, and staff given training.

Since it is a Halal restaurant, every single race in Miri converges here.At RM 5.20 per portion, the dishes are definitely worth it. I've been here twice, and the Dim Sum tastes amazing! Just look at the pictures! The glutinous rice with chicken was rich with flavour, and the fried bean curd rolls were as crisp as could be.

The place we had sat was reserved apparently. So we sat elsewhere.Then the menus arrived promptly and then nothing for 20 minutes. The place was busy, about 12 tables occupied, and only 2 hardworking waitresses were there, but we could not ""catch"" them as they went by despite are best efforts.Finally we cornered a waitress, and went through the familar game in Miri. The game is called ""Guess what we actually have"" . The game goes like this.You ask for something off the menu, and the waitress replies ""No have"". We got 5 ""No haves"" (at midday!) , and I lost patience and asked her to tell us what she did have.I wanted Chicken chop in garlic sauce. "" No have"" but they did have chicken chop oriental and chicken chop blah-blah but cannot knock up a garlic sauce to go with a plain chop? Go figure.So we ordered Beef in ginger & Chicken rice. It arrived reasonably quickly & my wife liked her chicken rice, but my beef had a chewy soft taste ( maybe the old baking soda trick with a cheap cut of beef?) with no real beef or ginger taste.The prices are a little above average, but this is reflected in the nice deco, air con, and clean surroundings. The menu has a wide choice on it, but I wonder how many ""no haves' are on it.In summary, this place has changed for the worse, and it may be on the slippery slope to ruin.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 20 July 2015 ,Ming Xin Coffee House

"borneo88Miri, Malaysia",Disappointing Indian promotion set lunch,"Decided to try out the Banana leaf set lunch but the Zest restaurant was fully booked with a meeting group so we were ushered into a private dining room on the side which was set up with 3 round banquet tables.My first instinct was to give it a miss since it felt odd sitting on a table for 10 with just 4 people but our guests had arrived in the meantime so we sat down and waited and waited and waited.Eventually, a waitress put a banana leaf in front of us and disappeared. She returned 10 minutes later to give us a dollop of sambal each. After a long wait she returned with a few bowls of rice and she emptied one each on the banana leaf. Another waitress asked us to choose between chicken curry, fried fish or egg. We decided on the fish and chicken and were given one small fried fish or a portion of chicken curry each. Finally, we were offered a spoonfull of cabbage and one small piece of eggplant.Oh, we also got a glass of cold water.Since no more food seemed to be forthcoming about 1 hour into the meal we got up and left to continue our lunch elsewhere since we were still hungry. A fate which other guests seated in our area suffered as well. I told the F&B Manager and was offered a 50% discount. We went to Tandoori Corner in Marina and had their Banana leaf lunch which was very tasty and plentiful.It was a pity that a 5star hotel like Marriott cannot get their food promotions right.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 9 November 2019 ,Zest

About a month ago I became vegetarian and this week was my first visit looking from a vegetarian perspective. Breakfast at Zest was fine, and there was a reasonable choice. We went out for evening meals, and that was awful from a vegetarian perspective and I wish we'd stayed with Zest to give a fairer trial. Lunch time, however, was a bit disappointing. The Poolside restaurant had only two options ... one salad or soup, so I headed for Zest. It turned out to be the same menu. Thankfully, the chef (I assume) overheard my dilemma and offered a vegetarian curry which was most welcome. However, I feel it is not really that difficult to have genuine vegetarian options in the menu, and I hope this will be considered in future.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 24 October 2019 ,Zest

The seafood station looks amazing but it isn't very clear on what you can have or how to have it, so I haven't been brave enough to try it yet. There is usually a beef stew on offer in the buffet area and the taste of carrots and mushrooms in it are delicious...Watch out for bones in it though, we got caught out with the children.

Mind you, this was at 7am in the morning and we were grumpy as hell, yet the lady by the counter -Her name tag read Rita- still managed to have us seated graciously and ensured we had all the necessary cutlery. As we went about making our selection from their breakfast buffet spread, the warm welcome we received from miss Rita was apparent in every other staff members; from the chefs like Shannon and Judd, who patiently described the dishes to us, to their supervisor Lily-we found out by asking her what her position was- their sense of hospitality can only be described as sincere.So, all in all, a splendid choice made for a random breakfast outing with friends due to their quality of service. One thing I must point out however is that the environment itself is pretty rustic. To those seeking an excellent meal for breakfast, I'd highly suggest this place.

Chaos.I guess they cooked and grouped it all up, but normally you get starter first and after a decent interval the main arrives.My steak & all veggies were cold, even though I started that first, and the starter which I had last was cold & stiff.

We'd chosen 4 different items from the a la carte menu (one of them was recommended by the waiter as a house specialty).  1. The garlic bread (RM 2.50 for 2 slices) lacked crispiness and was too oily. 2. The grilled teriyaki chicken with pumpkin cubes (RM 23) was a let down. The over-cooked chicken thigh was tough and chewy whereas the texture of each pumpkin cube differed significantly, with some being served raw. 3. The fritto miso (RM 22) - battered, deep fried sea food with chips (5% seafood + 95% flour)- was equally bad. Apart from the tiny pieces of prawn, the only other ingredient in the mix was small strips of fish which had a mushy texture. The batter coating was too thick and at RM 22 / serving, the dish is a real rip off.4. The worst offender is definitely the grilled red snapper with chicken ham and pasta (RM 19); unsuitably doused with a generous amount of melted cheese. The 'grilled' fish was tough and had an unpleasant smell which was off-putting. I highly doubt the freshness and the quality of the ingredient used. All in all, the Western-style food served at Cafe Rosita is overpriced (RM 13.50 for a pot of tea!) and lacked quality. It's obvious that Western-style cuisine is NOT their forte. In addition, the waitress who attended to our table was disengaged throughout our meal and came across as a little rude. If the 10% service charge were optional, we wouldn't have paid. If you're visiting this restaurant, be warned that Western isn't the way to go!Show less",1.0,Reviewed 19 December 2012 ,Cafe Rosita Coffee House

"kaylareveurMiri, Malaysia",One of the local's favourite restaurants - delicious and simply beautiful!,"Cafe Rosita is known amongst locals as one of the best restaurants to go to in Miri. Being a local myself, I could not agree more.This restaurant is located within Dynasty Hotel, Miri itself and caters to hotel guests as well as walk-in guests. The setting of this restaurant is simple, beautiful with very comfortable chairs and fully air-conditioned. The size of the restaurant is considerably large. Service is very good as well.The atmosphere here is absolutely homey and inviting - one of the reasons why my family and I love to come here. It has a very personal and private feel to it where you can stay there for hours while having a nice chat with friends or even meeting over lunch.Everything in the menu is excellent - from the appetizer, main course to the dessert. The lamb rack and sauce is superb. Even the Dynasty home-made bun is very good. I often come for the buffet lunch or dinner as you get to taste a bit of everything - and its still very cheap for what its actually worth! This is often the place where we come for special dinners (Valentine's, Christmas, birthdays.etc) and even had my brother's wedding lunch here this year (accommodates 160 paxs). There are other luxurious resorts around but food is not up to standard and has been too commercialised.The famous Sarawak delicacy ""umai"" here is one of the best I've tried so far. Basically it's raw fish mixed with chilli, ginger, vinegar and lime - its an explosion of taste as it has a unique combination of sweet, sour and spicy! If you aren't local, do take note that its for the more adventurous eater - but it's definitely worth a try.This is really one of the best-kept secrets where locals go and eat. I highly recommend it.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 24 November 2011 ,Cafe Rosita Coffee House

"Kiing239Miri,Sarawak",BAD FRONT LINE SERVICE,"I work in the service industry and I've had my share of bad experiences with people , at such, I made it a point to be courteous to any front-liners. But this branch of McDonald really need to improve thier staff training, especially the order queque. Sometimes we need to pack our car and wait for our orders to be delivered, which can be a long wait for a fast food chain. I agreed with KongJing26 & ShawnWong. The few times that I've been there, floor space were a bit dirty and the toilet, well .. wet and smelly & the crew just lack the efforts and its so obvious since its an open-kitchen.
