HensemNaan,Honestly not good,"Honestly not good. The lamb haneeth was obviously tender since anyone can cook it tender when u simmer it for that long. However it cannot go anymore blander than what my tastebuds felt that way. The rice was in big portion but obviously any arab place would serve equally large portions. There is no discernible difference between mandy, kabsa or other rice forms, so why bother?The shawarma was basically air wrapped pita. Very stingy with portions somehow, mayonnaiss tastes like unsweetened milk curd.It is somehow still packed with Shah Alam's most desensate-tongued patrons who continuously pleasure themselves with the illusion of good food.0/10 dont ever come hereShow less",1,Reviewed 27 November 2021 ,Mozer's

The meat portion sizes for the lamb and chicken shawarma 'platters' were much smaller then expected. In other countries a platter is a platter, here the platter was much less than a plate.

Lebanese Bread, Chicken Shwarma, Sheesh kebab, Foul, Hummus w lamb (my personal favourite), Healthy salads (that I find delightful) , falafel, several pasta dish (non mid eastern choice) and the best part, more & more dishes are added like monthly. Did I miss out rice? Well they do have rice of course. A variety of them Mendy Rice, kabsah rice, Iranian rice and makhlouba rice (sorry x sure of exact spelling). Its just that, For me their best product is non rice. At first we thought they are only open at night, what a pleasant surprise when I aproached the lady owner and she informed that they do lunch as well. Food price range from RM6 for a plate of Falafel or for a bowl of Hummus with a basket of bread, to RM20 for Grilled fish (delish!). Drinks? Mint tea of course- fresh mint in the pot just for RM4- a good deal for me & hubby. Yup they hv fruit juice : get the freshly blended one ! My mango juice or was yummy. Do give it a try if you happen to be in the neighbourhood. Am looking forward for Philly & Lamb Shwarma to be added to the menu. ^__^Show less",4,Reviewed 28 December 2012 ,Mozer's

"copycalebKlang, Malaysia",My personal favorite,"I have to highlight the title for this review. 'Personal' here means 'subjective' because bak kut teh is one of the most subjective dishes around. It's not like chicken rice where almost everyone can agree if it's good or bad. When it comes to bak kut teh, the range of preferences for the soup base to the cut of meat is immense. So, for me, I like my soup to be dense and richly flavored, and my meat to have both lean and fat parts, and I like all the other stuff that comes with the claypot - mushrooms, beancurd, etc. So, if this is your type of bak kut teh, then this is the spot.

The serving staff showed us a box with a few varieties of Chinese tea bags to choose. After choosing our favourite brand of Chinese, within minutes each of us was given two small tea cups and a pot of very hot tea for all. Another waiter came to take our BKT order. We had a standard dry Bak Kut Teh (BKT) in a clay pot for two persons without additional ingredients. It is pork braised until very soft in dark soya sauce with a little of salted fish. We then ordered the usual soupy BKT. We had to specify what other ingredients and particular types of pork to add to the herbal soup or broth. We ordered a clay pot of BKT for two persons with half lean, half fat pork, pig's stomach and tendons and pork ribs as well as shiitake that were added to the standard BKT soup/broth. We also had a small bowl of Yau Cha Kwai which went well with BKT and an ordinary plate of plainly fried Cos lettuce. We left the restaurant happy with the service, the fairly well cooked BKT that had a mild flavour of herbs and the generous topping up of the BKT herbal soup/broth.

"WilliamTan168Klang, Malaysia",Awful Service & Cocky Waitress,"To be fair, there were obviously some commendable points about this restaurant - free and ample car park both within and opposite the building; quite a nice ambience (even though no air-con) with decent interior adornments; and a visit to the washroom was quite an eye-opening experience for the first-comers like us. The initial impression was good, and the crabs together with other dishes that we ordered were generally quite tasty.Unfortunately, all these good qualities were easily overshadowed by the shoddy and arrogant service rendered by the restaurant.We brought some elderly guests and when they served us the peanuts as tidbits, we returned the same as they were too hard for the teeth of our guests. To our dismay, the waitress (ostensibly the captain of the service personnel) immediately pulled a long face and took away the tidbits in a very hard and unpleasant manner with words grumbling from her mouth, as if we owed her something.Subsequently came to the ordering of the dishes, as our guests were only conversant in Mandarin, we naturally spoke and communicated with the (same, yes) waitress in Mandarin. However, she insisted on conversing with us in Cantonese, whether deliberately or otherwise, and refused to explain further to our guests (in Mandarin) the cooking style of the dishes, and took our order in a harsh and hasty manner, leaving us with bewilderness and embarrassment in front of our guests.For the upmarket prices that we paid for the food there, we were only given a night market service. We also could not believe that in an era when even the Hong Kong people can speak better Mandarin than the Mainlanders, this 5 star restaurant had hired someone who could barely speak 1 star Mandarin. One is of course entitled to speak whichever vernacular he/she prefers in his/her own house, but this is not so (and cannot be so) when it comes to service industry.Lastly, the prices are definitely not commensurate with the qualities and types of the dishes offered there and the level of the restaurant. If you are willing to pay such a price for that kind of dishes, then there are so many other high class restaurants out there to choose from, where you would be treated like an emperor instead of being hurled with abusive words when you simply reject their tidbits.Show less",1,Reviewed 4 May 2016 ,South Sea Seafood

They do have a menu but the best way to order is to go up and chose your seafood and ask the service staff for the best way/most popular way to cook each type. Rarely are you disappointed with the recommendation. I had never had geoduck before and left it in the hands of the chefs to cook however they wanted. It was absolutely delicious. Something is to be said for a restaurant where you can just leave it in the hands of the chefs.Top dishes for me are: curry crab (sri lankan crab); nestum prawns (I ask them to de-shell it for me as I am lazy); lala with spring onions and ginger; razor clams and steamed fish. The veg is also cooked very well too. Also, be sure to order a coconut or two!As it's very popular I recommend booking ahead of time, especially for a weekend dinner.

Personally I don't like the Sweet & Sour Crabs, I recommend the 'kam heong' crabs. The service is excellent and well above expectations for a Chinese restaurant. Each waiter has his/her service station, and there were at least 2 waiters who were servicing our table (of only 5 pax). Eventhough the restaurant was packed to the brim, they pro-actively refilled our tea and changed our plates. Can't say the same for senior management though, they can come across as arrogant. There are parking service attendants with umbrellas to assist you on a rainy day, and parking is free too for dine-in customers unlike the other Chinese restaurants in KL. Advance reservations is recommendation especially for large group to avoid disappointment. The place gets really packed esp on weekends.Show less",4,Reviewed 24 February 2013 ,South Sea Seafood

We had to wait about 15min for our food but considering the crowd, it was quite quick. Furthermore we enjoyed watching the crew prepare the food like in a synchronised performance. We ordered the Nasi Campur, which is a mixed platter with rice and condiments; and it is served with tender grilled chicken, 2 prawns, squid, fish and minced meat on a lemongrass skewer. The condiments for the rice was dabomb! I could just finish the rice with the condiments alone! Another dish we ordered was the Sup Buntut. An Indonesian styled oxtail soup that came with rice cakes and a piece of garlic bread on the side. The soup was too oily so we skimmed away the layer of oil before digging in. The soup lacks a certain punch without the usual peppery taste that is expected from any decent Sup buntut. Their Drinks list were extensive but it is a halal restaurant so they only serve mocktails. We ordered a cucumber mohito and a lime and honey papaya ice blend. We felt that the drinks were too sweet so perhaps you can specify ""less sugar"" when placing your orders.

Now it is an Italian Restaurant. The restaurant is still the same, with great ambience and the nightly band adds a touch of romance with their beautiful songs. The staff was attentive and polite but the food was such a disappointment. We started with a sweet cherry tomato soup with fresh basil pesto and buffalo mozzarella (RM 43). It tasted as if coming out of a can, not fresh, no pesto and small bits of cheese. My husband had oven baked layer of eggplant parmigiana style with roma tomatoes and parmesan fondue (RM 37). This dish was very dry and did not taste like freshly made but rather as it just had been defrosted for convenience and no tomato taste at all.Then for our second course I ordered homemade durum saffron Maltagliati with cannellini bean puree and scallop (RM 58). That was one of the worst pasta I have ever tasted. All the pasta stuck together and it was laid in a starchy sauce with bits and pieces of uncooked scallops and completely tasteless. My husband ordered the pan roasted black Cod with mixed bell pepper and calamari (RM 112). The cod was definitely fresh and juicy but that's all. The calamari were all extremely chewy like rubber and were too hard to eat. Usually Italian chefs know how to cook them tender. Moreover the sauce was completely tasteless.One note of welcome surprise was the staff came with a cr√®me br√ªl√©e at the end of our meal to celebrate my husband's birthday and the band was kind to sing a birthday song for him. That was very touching.Since the Chef was nowhere in sight that night it is fair to say that his staff are completely useless and he is not a very good teacher. The waiting staff apologised for the entire meal flop and the supervisor told us the chef would visit us the following day and have a chat with us but alas he did not show up nor searched for us.

We kept the programme simple so that everyone could focus on the good food and I must say ......dinner went tremendously well thanks the chefs at Ti Chen. Everyone gave praise to the food especially the restaurant's special smoked duck, double boil soup and braised abalone. The mango dessert was just simply delicious. It was a five star meal and to say that in front of senior aunties and uncles who are food connoisseur equivalent is really something. Service was just fantastic. From the very start of organising this event, both Geetha from Saujana banquet and Jeffrey gave us their utmost attention and made accommodation to our requests. Parents of the groom who hosted the dinner was absolutely delighted with their choice to hold the wedding at Ti Chen. Another plus point is that Ti Chen sits beautifully by the lake and lightens up the mood and atmosphere for everyone who attended the wedding.

We had a great start from the attentive service from the manager, Mr. Jeffrey. From the point of reservation, menu design up to the actual event. His team was simply outstanding.Being personally attended by Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan) and they empathetically designed a menu which suited to the psychographic profiles of our guest. This is a definite differentiator compared to others.Also, chinese cuisine esp dim sum normally inclines to using pork as the base ingredient. Chef Yeow expertise is creating the texture from chicken meat as closely resembling pork texture and taste even better. That's an art!Then we have guests who do not take beef nor lamb, but Chef (Lim & Chan) impressed us with the chicken soup in black garlic, the unique lo hon chai and the outstanding sweet & sour fish. The service was simply outstanding. Our guests were totally impressed with not only the well thought through menu but the teamwork from the chefs up to the serving team. Our appreciation to Mr. Jeffrey, Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan) and the entire Ti Chen team. Gault-Millau should consider the ""nouvelle cuisine"" presented by Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan).

Salmon are not fresh and lucky is the very thinly slice. Smells fishy- Braised crab meat soup with assorted seafood and bamboo pith. This soup are the best dishes of this whole course. - Baked chicken in coconut milk and lemongrass served with crispy mantou. Chicken are tender even though it‚Äôs baked. The sauce are thick and yummy as it‚Äôs like sweet curry taste - Crispy prawn coated with lemon dressing garnished with tropical fruit salsa and tobikko. This dish just normal and it would be better if they use fresh fruits instead of canned fruits. Could use more sauce to coat the while crispy prawns.- Hongkong style steamed dragon grouper in superior sauce are nice but wasted as OVERCOOK. The yummy fish meat are hard what a waste. - Braised abalone 10head, sun dried mushrooms and fattchoy with broccoli are nice but it would be better to have more fattchoy on top. Sauce are nice and not salty.- Mini steamed glutinous rice with oyster and chicken wrapped in lotus leaf. The glutinous are yummy too as flavorful but not salty. -Chilled pumpkin pur√©e with sago and ice cream and crispy deep fried Chinese brown sugar balls are okay. Nothing special or wow.

We initially went to Saujana to look at other restaurants and venues for the dinner, but we chanced upon the Charcoal Grill Restaurant right before we left and immediately fell in love with the cosy and casual (but classy) setting of the restaurant. We met with the restaurant manager, Mr Mahesan, who was incredibly organised and helpful from the minute we met him. We only met him twice before the wedding - the first time on the day we went to visit Saujana and the second time a week before the dinner and him and his team pulled off the organisation of the wedding perfectly! The venue accommodates 150 people indoors comfortably and the dinner service (buffet) was priced very reasonably and included dishes like fresh prawns and oysters, sashimi, a variety of local dishes (including a full dessert spread). The service was impeccable and everyone was always within reach of a member of staff who provided service with a smile (no matter how late it got). Although there was a bit of a line when the guests went to get their food for the first time, the staff managed to organise the guests and get the line moving efficiently throughout the night. Everyone was so busy talking to each other in the line, the wait was completely bearable.Everything from the stage and backdrop to the mic and speakers were provided by the restaurant. I had my wedding playlist downloaded on my phone and planned to plug it in to the sound system that night but completely forgot about the iPhone audio jack adapter and was panicking about it 30 mins before the start of the dinner, but within 5 minutes of letting Mahesan know about this, he managed to borrow one off his colleague for the rest of the night just for us!We received so many compliments from the guests about the food and venue (my husband and I were so pleased about this because the buffet dinner concept was very different to the conventional sit-down Chinese wedding dinner), but everything went so smoothly. My husband and I did not have to worry about a single thing during the entire dinner and it was all thanks to the amazing service provided by Mahesan and his team at Charcoal Restaurant, Saujana Hotel.100% would recommend to anyone who wants a low fuss yet super classy wedding dinner in Malaysia!

This is rare but is common in some popular restaurants where I reckon the business is so good with more than enough customers to keep the tables full and the profits rolling in . The demand overrides the supply so to say . Many customers are willing to compromise if the taste of food can compensate this attitude of staff and some of them learn to accept it or accept it whenever they frequent this restaurant . As the Malaysian saying goes "" If you see the restaurant packed with people than the food must be good"". Good or not, this is so true about this restaurant .The restaurant used to be located near the Klang river on the Bukit Kuda stretch in front of Sri Intan Cinema before they shifted here . They have built up their large customer market for their renowned pork dishes especially for the ribs and chops during the 30 over years they have been in business . They used to serve very delicious pork dishes there but they are not as good today . However they still have a large customer base patronising their restaurant . They also have other complimentary Chinese food on their menu but as the name of the restaurant suggest, it is for "" Hakka paikut "" translated meaning ""Hakka pork ribs"" that attract many customers mainly of Chinese origin to dine at this restaurant .Show less",3,Reviewed 10 October 2014 ,Peng Heong Hakka Paikut Restaurant

DicksonO29,My number 1 Bak Kut Teh Place,"This restaurant have been around for a very long time. They used to be located in one of the shop lots opposite their current shop now but since a year or two ago, they have moved to this new location.I've been eating at this restaurant ever since I was still a kid and it has been maybe more than 15 years. This is the only place I go for Bak Kut Teh whenever I visit Klang or there are times where I will just drive all the way to Klang for this bak kut teh. (I stay in Sri Gombak, Batu Caves)What I order here is always the ""Sai Chi Kuat"" which translates to ""Small Bone"". If you ask those locals in Klang, thats what you should always order for Bak kut teh or you can also order ""Dai Chi Kuat"" (Big Bone). Most people from KL will always go for pork belly which I don't recommend at all because the pork belly part doesn't really absorb the rich taste of the soup. Also, you can have sea cucumber added to your bak kut teh. Here's a list of things you can add to your bak kut teh here or order a separate pot for it:1. Sea Cucumber - Add on 2. Beancurd Skin (Foo Chuk) - Add on/Separate Pot3. Enokitake (Needle Mushroom) - Add on / Separate Pot4. Pork Innards - Not sure (Since I don't eat innards)5. Yau Char Guai - Separate (Must Have for bak kut teh)Warning!!NEVER go for the dry bak kut teh here. The dry bak kut teh here is not nice at all. Only go for their soup bak kut teh. If you want to have dry bak kut teh, you can find better ones in Kepong. If you want to takeaway, always remember to ask for more soup to be packed or you will get very little amount of soup which will definitely not be enough. This has happened to me a few times and now we always ask them to pack more (though they will try to not give u a lot so you have to be quite persistent)Tips: If you are already eating here and wants to take away for dinner or the next meal, leave some pork/vegetables/foo chuck in your current pot of bak kut teh, ask them to refill the pot with soup and pack this so you get more soup for your takeaway. The price for one portion of bak kut teh (normal with no add ons for ""Sai Chi Kuat"") is RM 12 excluding rice, yau char guai. Usually I spend about RM 20 per person here with all the add ons.Show less",5,Reviewed 7 November 2018 ,Restoran Weng Heong

"sling44Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Friendly service, decent coffee, early breakfast","Whenever I'm at Atria I stop by here to get a decent cup of piccolo latte. And usually I end up staying a while longer than planned, reading a book or getting some work done. The food items (written on the wall) that I've tried so far were all tasty and freshly prepared. Not huge portions, but I tend to be more impressed by quality than quantity anyway. I especially like the lamb kebabs, the fruit salad with mint, and the muesli.What sets Antipodean apart - besides the fact that it's open-plan, smack in the middle of the mall, which may not be to everyone's liking - however, are two things: First, that it's one of the few places around that offer a western-style breakfast from 8:30am onwards. Most other caf√©s are still fast asleep at that time of day. And, second, its friendly and efficient staff. On one of my visits they mistakenly overcharged me, without my noticing it.

Literally everything ordered off the menu is good & tasty. The bento sets is always a popular choice and for those with a knack for something different, try the Uni (sea urchin). Admittedly it is quite pricey but the natural sweetness & creamy after taste of the uni is most definitely worth the a try.Apart from the food menu, Rakuzen also offers a wide variety of sake, with the option to be served hot or cold.

"Andy22LKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",One of the better Japanese restaurants in town,"I have been to Rakuzen many times either for lunch or dinner and the place has never failed to delight me. It is one of the places in town where the food is pretty close to what you get in Japan. Below is an overview of the place:Menu:There are several different menus to choose from - there is the regular ala carte menu showing a decent variety of typical Japanese fare such as salad, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, grilled seafood, tempura, noodles, beef dishes and hotpot, a lunch/dinner set menu which offers set meals at great value, and a super dining menu which showcases a selection of premium and exotic Japanese food.Pricing:If you were to compare this to the other popular Japanese chain restaurants in town, you will find Rakuzen's prices slightly higher. However, the quality and presentation of dishes at Rakuzen is of a higher standard compared to the others, so this is justified. One thing which the other chain restaurants lack is a set menu, so if you are looking out for a good value meal with some variety, then the set lunch/dinner may just be perfect for you.Service:I find service to be at an acceptable standard. On very busy days, you'd probably need to call the waiter to refill your cup with ocha as they will not be diligently checking your teacup levels. Do expect to wait a bit if you are ordering grilled dishes such as unagi kabayaki or saba/sanma shioyaki. One thing I always look out for when being served is whether the set meals are arranged and served properly in the traditional Japanese manner, eg. placement of chopsticks, positioning of the rice bowl, the soup bowl, etc.Ambience:Rakuzen in Empire Shopping Gallery is decently sized and is fitted out to have an authentic Japanese restaurant feel. Private dining rooms are also available for large groups. The ambience is pleasant and perfect for any occassion from a business lunch to casual dining with family and friends.Show less",4,Reviewed 25 September 2012 ,Rakuzen Japanese Restaurant

We visit Rakuzen perhaps every other month and rarely have we been disappointed. But since three members of the family are dieting, I suggested we order two sets to be shared between three. When the meal arrived my adult son decided that he was going to put off his diet to tomorrow. I looked at the amount of the set meal and decided ‚Äì yes one was enough to be shared between two. So husband and I ambitiously started our sharing of a bento box set. As I was eating my share I noticed my husband eyeing my plate ‚Äì he kept asking if I wanted more. Unusually thoughtful of him, I thought so happily I said I could do with some more of the teppanyaki. We finished everything between the two of us.

Arrived at 7.30am so there wasn't much of a crowd yet.Ordered 5 bowls of mixed meat, and 1 bowl each of taufu, taugua, chicken feet, and eggs.Soup didn't have much of a herbal taste, and was a bit to the salty side.The weird thing was that the bowls of meat consisted mostly of pork trotters. The pork trotters were not tender and were hard to chew. This was definitely NOT one of the places where it was cooked right.The chicken feet was also bland, tough, and didn't have much of a taste.Price wasn't too expensive and came up to about 100 for 5 adults and 2 kids.

Calvin L,Really Mediocre Japanese Food,"We decided to drop by after reading some reviews on this place. The place was easy to spot with a well decorated shop front and the door service was prompt and polite. The impression when we stepped in was awesome, we were welcomed quickly and the ambience was pretty good, with the smell of the grilled food. However, the Rattan chairs are hard and uncomfortable, if you have long hair and rest your head on the chair, it will get caught. So becareful.Overall, the price of the food was on the high side and their plastic laminated menu was not impressive. Showing signs of a cheap family restaurant but charging high prices. RM60 for 2 Miserables slices of Unagi, from Taiwan apparently, as advised by the waitress. Not being too quick to judge, we just ordered and waited for the food. The sashimi came first within 6mins, however the rest of the food came 15mins later. They should serve it back to back and not with such a long interval. The Ramen was a disaster. Do not order this dish. It was horrendous. The noodles we're soggy, soup was tasteless and there's alot of fat floating on the top of the broth, as shown in the photo. #pukesThe Pacific Perch has such a fowl smell when it arrived. Giving it the benefit of doubt, we tried it. The meat does not look fresh as it was very soggy and the meat is extremely salty. After one bite, we told them to remove it from the table as it was very smelly. The Soba was good, but not the tempura. The batter was soggy and soft, and as you can see from the photo, the size of a strand of soba is about the same size as the Prawn Tempura. Lastly the oyako Don was very mediocre and nothing special. Overall, the food quality of this place is really low, I think they really use cheap suppliers and the quality of food is definitely not there when is comes to finishing as well. This meal is highly disappointed and left us dissatisfied, as u can see, we didn't even finish half of our food. That's how bad it was. Maybe a more commercialized Rakuzen would be a much better option for the same price point. The crowd is really local with people in tshirt, shorts and slippers. Definitely not recommended for a business dinner.

"LoiChinKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",So so Sushi,"Located in an isolated area in Subang Jaya, it was dark and scary when we arrived. We hope our vehicles would be safe. Walking up 2 flights of steps, a small door opens up to a cosy restaurant. We were a party of 8 and had a small room to ourselves. It was warm in the room but it was freezing the last time we came, like summer and winter. Maybe it is the change of seasons! We did not enjoy our last visit or food because of the freezing temperature. Now it is hot instead!Being in a room has its advantages but the waiters can't see you if you need them. You have to go out of the room to hail them. A small gadget to hail waiters would be useful.After the order, food came promptly. But as we did not come together, those who order earlier got their food last! A no-no in restaurant service! Breaded pork was too dry. The bread was too crusty and rough. Sushi was average, the rice should be warm. The ramen so-so, with a small naruto floating on its surface. The udon look rubbery, should have been pre-soaked. Our cawanmushi came late after we finished our meals. This could be due to their extensive menu. Wonder how the cooks could master even one dish if not everything in the menu.The green tea was like tea flavoured water. Not like green tea at all.The bill came to RM 60+ each.For this amount, we could have gone to a all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet in Sri Petaling or Old Klang Rod, complete with oysters, of similar or better quality of food.Having been in Japan and eaten in numerous restaurants and stalls there, this restaurant is like a typical ""Tai Chow"" or a neighbourhood restaurant at home. Natives from there who missed home cooked meals will flock to this place. For non-natives, you can have endles list of choice of good Japanese restaurants at reasonable price.Prune down the menu, fix the air-conditioning and install a waiter hailing gadget, and you could go from zero to Jiro!!;Show less",3,Reviewed 19 April 2016 ,Kinpachi Japanese Restaurant

The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant, efficient and helpful. Their menu focuses primarily on Japanese cuisine which costs somewhere between RM60-RM80 per pax. Food is presented elegantly and the quality of their sushi, tempura, unagi, oysters and pork amongst others is worth the high price. As the restaurant is quite small, a group of 10-12 people would be comfortable, a larger group might be quite constraining space wise.

We had the platter of boiled chicken, char-siew and liver sausages. The slightly sweet caramelised pork was fatty enough to maintain its tenderness without being overtly dry. The char-siew is definitely the star here. Chicken was pretty much normal but the liver sausages had the right balance of umami to it. Its definitely worth trying if you have not. One can either choose to have wanton-noodles or rice to accompany the dishes. I didn‚Äôt try the noodles but the rice was just ok only-probably the rice strain they used wasn‚Äôt the premium ones. Very typical of coffeeshop style, varieties are limited but most customers come here for a very specific reason-to have their char-siew.

As I had enjoyed my dinner there (though pricey), I thought weekend buffet lunch would allow me to sample even more of their dishes at a fixed price.

The quality of the sashimi was fresh (5 types to choose from, though we find dinner cuts even better) and you get a variety of cooking styles dishes to choose from grilled, teppan, simmered, deep fry, menrui, rice and rolls etc. This is a pure Jap cuisine buffet, no fillers like local and western dishes to deviate your attention from Jap :-p. Though the price does seem steep (there's 20% discount with major credit cards), I do opined that it's still good value for money.

The temperature of the flame, clinging sounds of pans, and the fresh cooking smell just made you so excited for your food!I was even more lucky tonight that I spotted the Master was making a brand new bowl of fried rice. Once he finished one batch, I immediately ordered one. Maybe the Chef knew my intention (to try his rice), he immediately made me a brand new bowl! You could notice his sportmanship and showmanship right there and I really appreciated it! Not until I put the fresh fried rice in my mouth, the show went from the kitchen into my mouth! Each rice stands alone by itself yet each one of them are still moist! The bounciness of the rice was incredible! Fried rice is the most basic plate in culinary, but mastering it is like climbing Everest. If the timing and temperature is wrong, the rice would go to a point of no return and not able to be ""rescued"". Either they stick together or burnt.

"AndySenawiSingapore, Singapore",A must stop for the family,"PROS: Food, priceCONS: No reservations availableWHO: 10 pax (2 families from teens to 60s)My introduction to J&C was an enthusiastic brother who wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about their pastas and an equally excited mother who, traditionally would prefer to complain about restaurant food being stingy with ingredients, truly enjoyed their fusion of east and west. If mom likes it, I guess they pass the litmus test. I‚Äôve been there twice on the same number of occasions that I dropped by KL. They seem to do a lot of things right. Their Western dishes like pastas and steaks are very much authentic. Al dente noodles and properly done meats, you can‚Äôt go wrong with those fundamentals. And so are their Asian dishes. There‚Äôs this Chili Crab sauce and fried bun dish which I think is as good as it gets ‚Äì spicy, sweet and still strangely crab-ish without the crustacean ever making an appearance. You dip your fried buns for a snack that‚Äôs good for two or as a starter for four.You should also try their daily specials because the one I got was a generous helping of meat and some noodles. I can‚Äôt really tell what it was nor can I remember exactly what I ordered because there were too many dishes the both times we visited. It was glorious though. What I liked most about the place is that it has everything for everyone. Literally. There is something for every persuasion ‚Äì Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, Italian, you name it. And unlike so many places that do well for a handful of items and then half-hearted versions of the rest, I‚Äôm pleased every one of them is a star in its own right. To me, this allows a family‚Äôs worth of ‚ÄúI only eat this and not that‚Äùor ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat anything without rice‚Äù to be irrelevant because now, everyone has something to enjoy.

It's amazing that without any shortage of staff, a computerized ordering system and even communication device like a walkie talkie can lead to such confusion.To top that off, there is zero wow factor on the food. Portions are small and taste will not hit the spot. And to think about the price they charge with what you're getting, it's absolutely ridiculous. I will not recommend this place to anyone at all.

Checking out the menu, I definitely have to agree with the previous reviews on regards of the pricing for the foods. We just ordered their hotpot of seafood and salmon. The food arrived around 15 min after we ordered. The food turn out fine. Definitely a little more than average but not quite hit the wonderful button. We wanted to try out the cakes and had called up the service to check out the menu for their cakes but sadly they don't have one. Given that our seats is upstairs and i wore heel that time, we both just decided on our selection based on our glimpse earlier.The cake was a Ok but still not quite hitting the great level.

Come on...The Moroccan lamb pizza came shortly but it was such a heavy dish for a pizza. So chunky and it didn't really feel like a pizza and was fairly pretentious.

Asked if we could call for reservations next week he doesn't have a clue.He then proceeded with his own pace to get us a contact number for the event manager named Zack or jack or whatever.So we gave that ""busy"" person a call.

"LynnShaneKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Average Jibby,"My first experience here was back in May 2014 (which was a rather disappointing one) and recently I decided to give this place a 2nd try.Service was slow, there was a staff at the entrance assigning you to available tables. As my partner and I preferred to be seated upstairs (non-sharing w other diners), it took them quite some time to get us our preferred table. Finally, we saw a vacant table via the CCTV, but somehow their communication via walkie talkie was unclear and someone else who came later (who was wayyy back in the queue behind us) was assigned to that table for 2 upstairs. Food was rather average. Here are some of the food we've had from my recent and past visits.Salad - Chickpea salad and New Caesar Salad.There was nothing new or superb about it plus the portion was rather skimpy for the price you pay. Salads are priced from RM25-30.Mains - Pizza, meatballs pasta, smoked salmon on baguetteTheir pizzas are okay (worth a try), smoked salmon was rather good but once again, not value for money with the portion served. As for the meatballs pasta, the portion is fair. It was tasty but the meatballs were dry and hard. For all of the mains that we've tried, I can honestly say, I have tasted better, with better value for money serving portions.Prices for mains range between RM25-30+But I've seen the tables next to our's ordering their lamb etc, and it definitely looked appetizing. Interested diners, perhaps you could give this a try? Price is in the range of RM40 & above.Dessert - VolcarameloMy partner was there on a previous corporate occasion and apparently it was a BOMB! So, this time, it was a MUST Order for us. We told the staff that we'd like our dessert after meal. Understandably that this dessert takes quite a while to be served. But after about 30mins of waiting, we decided to check on our order, only to be told it'd take another 15mins. Our honest opinion? The previous staff (which put on a black face all the time whenever we called out to her) forgot to inform the kitchen of our order. Came the dessert. Presentation wise was a big fail. The inner chocolate filiings were already overflowing out from the cake. Otherwise, it would have been a 7/10 for me. I liked the crunchy bottom of the cake. Yet again, portion wise is very disappointing for a dessert that costs RM30 (w/o tax YET).**Note: They do have an extra charge of RM30 if you wish to celebrate your birthday by bringing in your own cake.Show less",3,Reviewed 23 August 2014 ,Jibby & Co

The restaurant is located on GK11 which is right outside of Starbucks. I was quite excited to try out this place. The concept of the restaurant is quite cool! It looks like a glass-green-house concept. The seating areas are on ground floor and the 1st floor. When I was there, the place was quite packed with lunch crowd. They have good spread of menus here; breakfast/brunch, finger food, salad, steak, burgers, pasta, pizza, Asian and off course, dessert.After browsing through the menu, I decided to try out the Soft Shell Crab Burger on Brioche (RM32). Since I was here with a bunch of people, the food took a while to reach us. Anyway I was quite excited to indulge the burger.The soft shell crab was fried well and seemed fresh to me. The seasoning of coating of the soft shell crab is just nice, not to over-powering. They had the Asian coleslaw on the burger buns which tasted pretty normal. Served with sweet potato friends and spicy sauce.We also had Shredded Duck Pasta which was really good! Another pasta dish I had tasted was the Tiger prawn & Blue Swimmer Crab pasta which was good as well. Here are the pictures!The have cakes on display and some looked really yummy. If that doesn't tickle your taste bud, you can always order from the menu. I had the flat white coffee (no pictures sorry!) which was okay.Overall, like the food. Service was good except the food and drinks which arrived late. The seating area on 1st floor (where I was at) is quite warm. Although there are some air-con vents but it feels warm most likely due to the glass house concept. Perhaps a mist-fan will do the trick? Something to really consider about.

Roam767452,Gourmet Vouchers,I had lunch here with family last Saturday-20/12/19. I was not satisfied with the manner Kaits restaurant handled my situation. I had vouchers of RM300 and other voucher to collect a bottle of wine and cake. The restaurant had some restriction on the manner to redeem voucher which they claim to be cash voucher. The voucher clearly spelled out that at any point of time there can only be 2 vouchers use for the same reservation. So I suggested to the manager to split the bills where I will pay by my self using 1 voucher and the other 2 vouchers will be use for another bill of 2person. This was decline by the manager. Then I suggested that I will use 2 of the vouchers and collect the wine & cake but the manager decline and said that 'CASH' voucher cannot be use to claim the wine. This was not spelt out at the back of the voucher at all. I visited the same place last year and had lunch with my family and collected the wine without any problems. The manager claimed that the rules have changed since Sept19 but these changes was not informed to members like me. My wife called Gourmet Collection and demanded for an explaination.

When we walked in we made it very clear to your Manager on duty that only 4 of us were there, so you can imagine our surprise when we were billed for 5 at the end of the night. Your reasoning: It‚Äôs your policy to charge us based on our reservations. This is the most ludicrous thing we‚Äôve ever heard. None of us have ever encountered or heard of something like this before. Furthermore, if it was your so-called policy, then one of the following should be in place:1. This policy should be clearly indicated on your website.2. We could have been told about the ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù when we called to make reservations/when you called us to confirm our reservations.3. Your Manager on duty could have informed us about the ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù when we arrived.None of the above are in place, so how can you justify charging us for 5 people? Your staff eventually agreed to waive the cost for the 5th person after we argued our points, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a matter of your principals in handling a situation like this.In addition to that, the fact that your buffet is RM98++ is extremely steep, especially if you are obviously not able to cater to the throngs of people that were they. If all your patrons are being charged the same amount, then each of us should get the same experience. We were seated in a corner, next to the Pump Room, with no proper ventilation. It was extremely stuffy as it was outdoors ‚Äì there were no fans either. So what I don‚Äôt understand is why do we have to pay the same as the other person who gets to sit in an air conditioned room, with nicer tables and chairs? Should each person not get the same experience? In addition to that, the food was nothing to shout about.I am of the opinion that Ramadhan buffets have become a money making scheme for all hotels these days. There‚Äôs only one objective in mind: to make as much money during this 30 day period. You wanting to charge us for 5 instead of 4 only reinforces this fact for me.This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I can only assume that the Holiday Inn brand is not at all customer-centered.

"esthercyt93Subang Jaya, Malaysia",It wasn't worth it..,"My husband and I had Kampachi's Sunday lunch buffer spread. I was very excited but it was a let down. The grilled seafood (crab legs, flower crabs, river prawn) was so dry and mushy which tells us it's not fresh and frozen to a point I thought I was watching Frozen 3. RM6 for a cup of green tea? That's a rip off. The overall buffet spread wasn't up to par as choices of food are limited. The place that we sat was warm and could hardly feel the air-conditioner. The only thing that salvaged the dining experience was the young teppanyaki chef who cooked our beef perfectly, fresh sashimi platter and that friendly chef who served us a bowl of teriyaki beef bowl (stationed next to the seafood grill). We didn't even bother to ask for the complimentary Birthday dessert and decided to leave. The price that we pay, was not worth it at all. I'd rather head down to Mitasu @ Central Plaza - affordable, standards and quality are consistent despite me revisiting that place several times.Show less",2,Reviewed 23 December 2019 ,Kampachi Plaza33

geegee-pei,Overrated and lousy weekend lunch buffet. Overpriced and below par food served,"Went there last Sunday for their weekend lunch buffet for rm148. I was there couple weeks ago for business lunch and it was good and subsequently recommended by the manager -Edward to try out the weekend lunch,boasting slipper lobster and snow crab for the price of rm148 per month. What a disappointment! Although it's a buffet spread, given the price, the restaurant ought to prepare more fresh food for the customers. Lobster and snow crab was not fresh and so dry. None of us enjoy it at All! Ordered medium done teppanyaki beef and the meat was tough. The teppanyaki salmon was so dry and we couldn't eat it at all. Basic food ie fried food such as tempurara was equally bad. Over fried. Even the fruits - watermelon, grapes and honey dew were not fresh and some of the grapes had turned sour! The only thing that was edible was the unagi,sukiyaki. For the piece I've paid to bring the whole family there (spent rm610; bear in mind rm148 buffet doesn't include green tea which they charged additional rm6 per pax),i could have a way better and decent Japanese meal elsewhere. I will not visit again.

341angelinesMalaysia,Sunday lunch buffet,"I have dined in this restaurant several times (at least 4-5 times this year) for their Sunday lunch buffet, and I have several comments:PROS:1. Firstly, great food. No complaints in regards to the freshness of the sashimi. Variety of food is good, so for some who don't fancy raw foods, the cooked foods section is more than adequate to please. Although from my experience the tempura prawns or the miso halibut seem to run out pretty quickly, it is quite quickly restocked.2. Making reservation is highly recommended as I have seen this restaurant when it's full-house. It does get pretty busy on some SundaysCONS:I absolutely hated sitting at the ""bird's nest"" seats near the entrance. During my last 2 visits to the restaurant, I was given those seats, much to my frustration. When I first sat there, I immediately noticed that the air-conditioning was bad at that section and I started sweating even before the meal. I wanted to request to change tables immediately, but of course, no waiters were allocated to take care of the section. Instead, most waiters were posted at the inner main seating area. Waving at waiters who were all standing so far away didn't worked. Hence, after a few minutes of frustration, I walked to the entrance to speak to the staff for a table change. I was told the ""bird's nest"" seats were for small groups and that the main area is only for large families (not true, by the way. I previously sat in the main seating area even though it was just me and my fiance). As I didn't want to make a fuss, I attempted to settle down at that miserable section. When I was finally ready to order a pot of tea, again my attempts at gaining the attention of the waiters failed. Due to the design of the seats & table, it was hard for waiters to see my waving hands; and of course all the waiters were at the main seating area. Again, I had to get up and walk to the main entrance to tell the staff that I want to order tea, and again, I requested to change tables because this is just ridiculous. Again, I was refused. As a consolation, I was given a buzzer-type device so that I can call for the waiter. During that same visit, I saw other patrons who sat at the same section getting frustrated too with the lack of attention from waiters. One family even took their pile of dirty plates and placed it directly at the bar counter as their table was not cleared.As for my most recent visit on 29th July 2018, I immediately requested for a table at the main area after being led to this awful section. My request was denied. This time, I immediately told the waitress I want the buzzer device as I don't see any waiters in this section of the restaurant. Anyway, the area was still hot with weak air-conditioning. But what made me really irritated was when I saw several other tables in the main seating area with 2 patrons only. How is it that some patrons get to sit in the more comfortable main area, and my requests for table-change was denied in 2 visits? These past 2 experiences were truly awful, but only because I had to eat while being sweaty and getting irritated from the lack of attention from staff.Over all, my biggest advice is to go there for the food only. Service and seating-wise, they are subjective and depends on your luck. Obviously, ambience is totally 0% if you have the misfortune of being seated near the entrance (Imagine being sweaty and waving your hands around like a monkey just to get the waiters' attention, which was what I did).Show less",3,Reviewed 4 August 2018 ,Kampachi Plaza33

"kiangtravellarGeorge Town, Malaysia",Re: very pricey,"Had dinner here for the second time within the last 2 years. Realised that the average price per main course is RM50. I ordered the unajyu set dinner that comprises small pieces of ? Chicken/ tuna pieces, 3 pieces of salmon, soup and tiny 2cmx2cm of fruits, about 4 pieces ( 2x watermelon, melon and pineapple),and finally the grilled eel that was rather small too. In all, the eel was good, salmon sashimi was also fresh. But the portions were simply too small for the high price that we were paying. This was also true for the other set meals. Although i feel that this is indeed a nice restaurant, i feel that the prices are simply too high and unjustified. If only, the restaurant can be a little more generous in their portions,then i may become a loyal customer. But until then, this is my last visit to kampachi plaza 33.

"ongjanice1Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Satisfied,"I do not enjoy Japanese buffets simply because most of the restaurants serves crappy shashimi & the spread are not appetising & the who dines there are very noisy. Anyway, I gave this place a try because Kampachi has always been known for their great Japanese buffets. First thing u must remember is to make reservations (I was there on a Sunday) because this place is fully patronised by 1pm. We paid about RM142.50 / person (including tax & service charge + green tea). Food : The spread is quite good and fresh. Chawanmushi is soooo good (I am not a fan but I tried it anyway and never regretted). The garlic fried rice is kinda let down. Love the desserts!!! Have to try the muachi because they are served warm. The ice cream goes very well with the red bean paste.Service : Very good because the service staff are helpful and courteousWill I come again : Definitely but not too often because the price is premium / headShow less",4,Reviewed 10 October 2014 ,Kampachi Plaza33

I came to visit a shopping mall, 'Aeon'. After reading and acknowledging a confident and positive review on the popular restaurant 'Deli Rich', I found the review and or the description of the restaurant to be perfect for me. As I entered the restaurant, I was welcomed by the friendly staff of Deli Rich wearing their bright orange T-shirts, their sweet looking smiles and the two words ""salamat dating"" which after they realised I was not a local they translated it to English as ""Welcome"". I was then escorted to a table, my chair was pulled out for me, and I was given a menu. Looking at the menu; I noticed a broad variety of traditional cultural meals, Asian, Western , Italian , Chinese and Japanese. There was also a wide range of drinks ranging from hot to cold. To add to this, the prices were very affordable although beinglocated in a well known popular main shopping all. I decided to eat and therefore ordered the traditional Malaysian meal 'Nasi Ayam' (chicken rice). After a quick wait of approximately 10 minutes, my meal came to me freshly hot on a nice unique plate and with cutlery.

Menu spread was very informative & image-heavy.Food - I think the potato + leek soup was way delicious than the mushroom soup as an appetizer. Garlic bread was not crunchy, a bit stale. But I've always assumed baguette as stale (LOL). I've had medium well sirloin steak (8oz) and it was very delicious, tender and melted right in my mouth! It was probably the BEST STEAK I've ever had compared to other pricey restaurants that weren't consistent. Black pepper sauce was too strong on its own but when paired with the steak, the taste was divine. They used Australian beef apparently; side salad was fresh & crunchy. However, the side potato cake was so-so; cold, very starchy and felt like it was made earlier in the day. Frutti di mare was delicious too! The spaghetti was al dente; not overcooked & still have a bite to it. It's quite a big portion also so you may share! My sis-in-law had the chicken chop and she commented the side pie was a letdown. I guess this restaurant focused too much on the main star of the dish (i.e the protein) that it forgot the side dishes were important as well. Didn't order dessert because I was so full!

We also ordered their crispy pork salad which had hints of kaffir lime leaf, pineapple, mango & slivers of almond. Loved the dressing which was light, refreshing & zesty. Another must try is their crispy duck on a bed of white rice with 3 different sambal sauces. Service was fast & staff were friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is lively albeit rather noisy as every now & then they break into a song & dance to wish diners celebrating their birthdays there. All in good fun though.Show less",4,Reviewed 24 June 2016 ,Naughty Nuri's Subang The Courtyard

"Su Ching OKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Overated !!!,"It's the latest spot for family dinner if opting for a western meal. But the restaurant is just so noisy that you cant possibly hold a conversation with anyone. So it's not a place for family gathering - no space for bonding or talking. Yes, most people would love the place and say its fun. Merry place! Staff are pretty friendly and would sing and dance with birthday boy/girl. But you get the feeling that the staff is hurrying you to order, hurrying you to go off. Keep coming to you to order and keep coming to take plates and keep coming to do this and that till you leave the table. Cant blame them, the queue is come in is long outside, very stressful for diners. Not a place for slow and relaxing meal.Price are reasonable for main - market rate but the sides aint cheap. No free water/air kosong, so the drinks bill will ring up here.Taste wise - ok la. Would say above average but not until you go ""wah""... The babi guling was tasty - I love the crispy skin - my favourite part.Overall, stressful and noisy place - certainly not my kind of place for family to meet up and converse.

"Shoebox3Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Food is good but Horrible Service.,"Went at 625pm last Saturday evening, and the our hostess noted that we have to leave by 730pm. Was all good as we got a table nearby the open air balcony. Half way through our meal, they sat a couple adjacent to our table (arms' length) and they started smoking. Initially, i was still obliging even though their smokes were blowing towards us. It was when i saw the smoke ashes landed on my table and food that i stopped eating, told the waitress what happened and requested for a change of table. She listened, wipe the ashes on the table with her hand and walked away. We waited and then, stopped another waiter for the same request. He then said ok and walked way.. We caught up with him again after several minutes and his response was, we would have wait for a while since there is no table available. Noting that the restaurant was only around 60% occupied by then. We requested for the manager.. The same waiter came back without the manager and kept repeating that we would have to wait for table change. At this point, we had to raise our voice before the manager finally came to our table. So, within minutes of explaining, we got a new table. We finished our food within 10 minutes and left. The restaurant should have a clear segregated area of smoking and non smoking dining. Despite the ribs may be good, they seemed to think smoke ashes onto customer food is not an issue and attempted to sideline us into putting up with the crap, just because they want to reserve empty tables for other potential customers. If you don't mind the time limitation and putting up with such services, why not. But if you think your money is better off being spent at places which would appreciate your business, am on board with that.Show less",3,Reviewed 14 March 2016 ,Naughty Nuri's Subang The Courtyard

When we walked into the restaurant at 1210pm, two staff were at the front and some at the Sushi bar. None of them greeted us. I have to inform them I have made a reservation. I thought the restaurant opens at 12pm! 4. I asked the waitress what was the Gunkan promotion, the colorful menu was on the table. The waitress said she doesn't know. Omg! 5. My business partner got his California Temaki, then his Gindara set. But...Where's my Sashimi set??? I asked the waitress..Then...3rd came the Gunkan. I have to ask again and again when was my Sashimi set since my other guest has already halfway into his Gindara set. It's about 15min later I got my Sashimi set. I think Miyabi has coordination issue, it's out of sync. Furthermore, the waitress need to be trained to be able to answer questions about the menu. How can she not know the items on promotion!I love the Sheraton PJ where every employee is so friendly. Miyabi was my first disappointment. I hope the service will be improved soon!

"ECKLKualaLumpurKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Less is More Part 352 - Complacent Clumsy Cloddish Communication ,"First of all, for a hotel that has been in operation for a year (I was told by a manager), there are still bothersome inconsistencies between its online communication and what‚Äôs on the ground. I‚Äôm surprised no one noticed it. It started with our intention to have lunch here on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Having ‚Äòheard‚Äô of the stunning rooftop views, I checked the website to note that rooftop Sala was open for lunch and dinner. When we arrived at the main lobby, we double-checked with front desk and was informed that we could order a la carte lunch in Sala. Reaching the rooftop, it became apparent that it was certainly not set up to serve meals. We asked the barman and was told that Sala only had snacks. So we trekked back downstairs to look for a lunch alternative. It was by default that we ended up at Miyabi. The environment is quite elegant and beautifully decorated with stunning black and white marbles. While it positions itself as 5-star, in reality the service level manages no more than 4. The sushi chefs all look like foreign workers and I don‚Äôt mean Japanese. The servers appear to be fresh out of hospitality school. Very polite nonetheless but awkward and inexperienced. We ordered the sushi/udon and sashimi sets, a tempura udon and the December special lobster tempura with yuzu butter. The food was served at different intervals. Given the low lunch traffic when we were there, there should not be any excuse not to serve the three meals together. There is nothing extraordinary about the food - very regular and run-of-the-mill. Aside from an above average chawanmushi, the rest was actually below. In fact the various cuts of seafood on the sushi was so disproportionately thin compared to the rice it sits on, it‚Äôs embarrassing. And we had to wait and wait for the lobster tempura - that came out long after we had finished our main meal. Were they defrosting it? The tempura batter turned out doughy and greasy. Dessert was fruit slices that had obviously been sitting in the refrigerator. Is it so difficult to cut them fresh?With the proliferation of Japanese restaurants around town offering such high quality and authentic food, a reputable establishment like Sheraton should not settle for what they have right now. Quite disappointing. Show less",3,Reviewed 1 January 2019 ,Miyabi

"rcaustin9161Clawson, Michigan","Amazing Food, High Cost Upselling & Terrible Service","Have been to Miyabi twice this year and similar experiences both times.Start with the food - amazing! Tried different things from Sashimi to grilled beef, grilled salmon to tepanyaki - all delicious and fresh. Highly recommend the food.Now the upselling - first time the waiter recommended a mix of Sashimi, a steak and a bit more - the bill was nearly 500 MYR in food alone for one person. Buyer be ware - he sells nicely but never mentions the cost. This time in June was there for a work event post workshop with 10 people. Had a budget so we fixed a menu in advance. First waiter comes in, knows we have the set menu, asks if we would like drinks. All is good. The second waiter comes in (same guy from first visit) and starts trying to upsell sashimi appetizers, offering specials for meals and getting my guests excited. Needless to say I am furious as I have to be the bad guy and turn all this down, losing face to some of the colleagues as ""why is the company being cheap"". Then after I stated that we had the set menu, he asks ""are you sure you don't want to add to it?"". Unacceptable.Service - 4 of us ordered beers. 2 came. 1 came 10 minutes later. Had to ask for the 4th beer after 15 more minutes. No apology. Ordered a second round. Same thing - delivered the beers one by one and took over 30 minutes to get 5 beer. I had to go and find the upselling waiter to demand to know what is going on - received a quick sorry sorry - and again said this is unacceptable - why can't you deliver draft beers together - to which no answer was given. Final round and for the final time, they could not manage to deliver all at once. No process improvement, no care, no concern. No round of drinks for free, no acknowledgement there was a problem from them.They did manage to constantly refill the green tea, but as soon as the meal was done, no more green tea while we continued talking (and waiting on the beers).

leecam156,Disappointing Hi Tea Buffet!,"I just attended the Hi Tea Buffet today and I am very very disappointed. Firstly, for a high ‚Äòtea‚Äô buffet, there wasn‚Äôt even any tea served! No option of any drinks besides water! Even a simple bed and breakfast would have at least orange juice as standard. This is appalling! Secondly, there was very limited options. I have been to many other hi tea buffets and this is perhaps one of the most limited options I have experienced! If mco and less crowd is the reason then perhaps the price should also be reduced accordingly. But instead, the price is exorbitant for such a spread. And my guest had to wait 20 mins for a satay to be served! The roast lamb on display was almost left with only bones at only 1pm! My other guest who is a vegetarian had very limited options. Even dessert was limited and Malaysian food selection was non-existent! Not even a roti canai/kueh/Mee goreng!To add to this, the staff were not even aware of my cake order until I insisted there was one pre-ordered and they had to search for the order. That wasn‚Äôt even ready until I asked when in fact someone should have come to ask when I wanted the cake!Thoroughly disappointed as I expected much more from a well-established 5 star hotel.Show less",1,Reviewed 20 December 2020 ,Paya Serai

Eventually our orders came but we were distracted by the commotion next table: a waiter was berated for slowness in delivery as the group unlike ours was there for office lunch and they waited a mite too long. Poor waiter.Our orders albeit the wait was actually very good especially the bamboo briyani which came in a platter of bamboo rice (in a real bamboo) and a sizeable chunk of scrumptious lamb. So was the nasi ulam, a healthy meal of rice, chicken and fresh greens.I settled for the cajun chicken sandwich to avoid guilt.And since it was a birthday lunch, a slice of delicious chocolate cake was presented on the house.Best of all, our vouchers entitled us to have a hearty lunch for four at only RM30!Perhaps during the MCO, Paya Serai should insist that guests who booked the lunch hour must pre order, or risk waiting long.Show less",3,Reviewed 17 September 2020 ,Paya Serai

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",FIRST ONLINE ORDER,"Every Ramadan, we decided to eat simple, content with pasar malam takeaways, and never allowing a full meal to affect the blessed month of fasting and praying. But the last day of fasting was always at Paya Serai as there was no rush to go for terawih prayers and we indulged after a month of abstinence.But 2020 was a challenge due to the MCO and we thought we had to forgo this experience. But no, PJH offered online orders of different menus during Ramadan and Syawal, and we ordered one set after the 6 days of puasa enam ie Ramadan and Syawal fasting obligations over!And my what a set it was. Priced at slightly above rm300, we got the following Hari Raya delicacies: nasi briani with ayam panggang percik,dendeng, mutton briani, sweet sour fish, sambal prawn and vegetables, laksa johor, lontong, ketupat and lemang with rendang and serunding chicken and beef, murtabak ayam plus desserts of french pastries, pineapple tart, bread and butter pudding and kuih raya. It was meant for five people and there were only four of us. So with the help of the freezer, we stretched out the meal over three days!Best dish? All voted for the scrumptious laksa johor, but the rest of the food was great tasting as well. it was a bargain as we did not have to finish everything in one sitting but we were also mindful of the advisory attached to the Hilton bag regarding duration of keeping the food fresh and consumable.Paya Serai, you outdid yourself and kudos to the Chefs, it was a fantastic gastronomic journey that reminded us that Hilton delivers, even in trying times.

"SuSankar1999Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Christmas eve buffet dinner- a letdown,"Recently, a friend and i went for the much hyped Christmas Eve buffet dinner at Paya Serai in PJ Hilton. I used to come here a lot a few years ago due to the selection and great tasting food. Unfortunately, the reputation has taken a severe beating in my opinion. The food selection was poor and limited. While they had the usual turkey and the trimmings (which to be fair, was nicely done) the rest of fare was quite disappointing. The taste of some of the dishes was surprisingly bad with some par ingredients. When some of the dishes ran out, it was not replenished. For a buffet service, it doesn't make sense to not replenish an item that was finished an hour and a half before the buffet closes. The dessert counter was quite pathetic and those that were served could have been given more attention during preparation. All in all, the whole thing was a waste of money. Would not recommend it again. On the plus side, The few staffs that were around, were very friendly and kind. But having said that, they were too few people working the tables. We even talked to other patrons who were trying to get someone to clear the plates and replenish water and there was only 1-2 staffs doing that.

BBQ items (lamb, beef, sausages) are not prominently displayed and r instead hidden on the back counter like they hope no one will see it and order it. Anyway it‚Äôs cooked so badly right before your eyes so u might not want to eat the rubberized meat anyway. The only thing worse was the pasta station which I have no words for.

It's not that it's bad-it just isn't great and for the name and the price that's not really good enough. On entering the buffet it looks like there's a lot on offer. However, once you've been around a couple of times, you start struggling. The dishes all have a certain blandness that is fairly typical of major hotels in KL. As all locals and residents know even the cheapest roadside stall will give you tastier local food. The international sections are also a bit disappointing. They look appetizing up to a point, but taste-wise there's always something missing. Might as well pop into Uncle Chillis for some western food with a bit of oomph!So, as usual our large group left wondering why we'd done it to ourselves again.

"MiinHway FKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Cozy Ambience,"Went there for dinner, selections were poor, only local fair, mainly malay or nyonya dishes. Not much cold cuts too, there are limited choices of seafood available, and the crabs look miserable. Food taste was mediocre, there was a wide variety of salad though. There are only two types of soup served, mushroom soup and si chuan soup. Sichuan Soup was starchy, but I liked the mushroom soup which was pretty authentic. Drinks are not inclusive inside the buffet price, therefore you have to place order with the servers. Service was relatively slow and the air conditioning vent was not working at the corner we were sitting. I was practically sweating while I eat. The main saving grace was the chocolate fountain in the middle of all the food served. You can dip the marshmallows, fruits in chocolate, which was quite fun.

"lalalyzzPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",A Let Down,"My family and I were here earlier for their iftar/ dinner buffet. Well. Now. I have a lot to say. First: The crowd: Glutton and I must say, almost barbaric. It was as if they couldn't grasp the concept of attending a buffet. There was no system and everywhere I looked the place was nothing but an eye sore. Kids were minging everywhere. Second: Foods were not replenished immediately. The guests had completely emptied some of the dishes 10 minutes into the buffet. Third: Plates were only available at 2 sections. At one point I wanted to get hold of some lamb curry that was located near the cashier. I had to hustle through the crowd all the way to the back to get a plate. I don't mind the wait & the walk. But like I mentioned earlier, the crowd could easily get on your nerves. Fourth: Plates, glasses & cutleries had stains on them. Also. When we arrived, we were short of cutleries & napkins. Fifth: most of the servers ignored us. There was a nice Nepalese lad, Deniya, the only one who never failed to attend to us. Sixth: when I asked the staff where to get certain dishes, they didn't know which was which and were just as completely lost as I was. Seventh: Upon payment, we were asked how many of us showed up. (We initially booked a second table for our dear Mom and her friends. We cancelled it before the buffet since the crowd was inappropriate for a reunion. They had their dinner at Genji, a Japanese restaurant on the first floor). When we said 3 (only my sister, myself, and my brother were evidently present), the cashier, Azuna or something, snickered and condescendingly asked ""3..? Really? Are you sure? 3 of you?"". To each of that we nicely answered yes and nodded harder than a bobblehead. I wasn't having it. I went, ""Don't you believe us? Don't you need to have trust in your customers should you wish to earn it from them?""She did apologise afterwards when she gave us our change. We didn't leave our tip there. We tipped the servers in person. And so should you. Eighth: Food: I wish I didn't have to do this. But honestly, it's merely decent here. Nothing was good. If you're looking for a traditional cuisine be it Indian, Malay, Chinese, it's not worth it. Ninth: Cleanliness:The worst part was the arrangement. Floor & food stations were dirty, there were food bits and spills everywhere. Utensils were oily and disgusting. Again this reflects back on the customers as well. Drinking glasses were placed upward (unhygienic). There were plenty of used glasses amongst the clean ones. Again, the crowd. Tenth: buffet for 3 was RM 357. I don't think it should be that expensive given the food quality & service weren't up to our expectation. Eleventh: Parking basement: Looks sketchy. A complete maze. If you have thyroid and failing eyes like me, you're not gonna enjoy circling around the narrow maze. The building is basically just old and hasn't been renovated.Our huge car couldn't manoeuvre around certain corners. (We are fatties. Hence the cruiser)Twelfth: Parking is expensive here. RM 18 per entry. Everyone was given an RM 8 discount. Nice gesture. But looking at the parking bay, you'll be blown away. Some were upset to find out the parking fee. They had that 'yong soi' (black face) look on them. Despite everything I've mentioned, I was here a few times years ago. The last was 2 years ago. Buffet was better then. Maybe √† la carte's better here. Who knows. I'm not gonna give it a try.Show less",1,Reviewed 4 July 2016 ,Paya Serai

tkzrea,Not as great as what it used to be,"I do come to this restaurant quite often, previously for business lunches but now usually for a business drinks only. Sometimes I have the family here to dine for their buffet here which has been almost an well known attraction of this restaurant for many years (I am talking about at least 20 years). Up until recently, I have always thought the food was above par but now I have come to believe that it is now just average in taste, especially when one considers the prices they charge being a restaurant in a five star hotel i.e. The Hilton. The standards and taste have dwindled over the years and as a regular patron, you come to realize this quite quickly. In fact, whilst having to relax at the lounge recently, I decided to ask for on the menu pepperoni pizza and what they served me was a small plain pizza topped with sliced frankfurters. I don't think this should come from a 5-star hotel.Nevertheless, I must say the ambience is still cozy, despite having a lobby that is usually filled with people. The service provided by the staff there is also very good. Unfortunately, there are times you get smokers in the lounge which is located in front of the restaurant. For some reason, the management do not discourage them from smoking, but to be fair, this occurrence appears to be lesser now. On the overall, this restaurant and the lounge in front of it do provide services which is of acceptable standards. I would probably patronize the lounge again as it is a very convenient place to have a business discussion; given the nice set up. However, this may not be enough to persuade me to bring my guests or family for a meal any longer since the quality of the cuisines and the presentation have not kept up with present standards. One must consider that there are many other restaurants to choose from in that area given the prices this restaurant charges, and unless the management does something to improve it, I am afraid their patrons will be limited to mainly their hotel guests; which may not be aware of the presence of nearby restaurants.Show less",3,Reviewed 21 December 2015 ,Paya Serai

maymaymieMalacca,"Poor Service, Mediocre Food, and Expensive Parking at Paya Serai High Tea Buffet","Bad experience at Paya Serai High Tea Buffet today. The service is appaling. We arrived 15 minutes early for their weekend high tea buffet which starts at 12.30pm. There was no one manning the entrance, so I walked in to find someone. There were plenty of waitress and kitchen staff walking around but no one bothered to greet and ask for your reservation or seat you down. Few other guests were also walking around waiting to catch the attention of someone to direct them to their tables. Finally I approched a waitress who lead me to my reserved table. Once seated, you are left alone, they don't ask if you'd like iced water, nor automatically bring you iced water (unlike other hotels). 30 minutes into our meal we were still not served any water, and my husband had to flag a waiter down to ask for water for the table. Tables were slow to be cleared, even when there were at least 3 servers at our section. So we just stacked our dirty plates on top of each other. The buffet spread was mediocre. Not much choices and mediocre in quality. There was no seafood section at all, no oysters, prawns, crabs, scallops, mussels on ice etc....there was no japanese or italian section either. The chinese food was very disappointing, the Malay section was the best among all. Dessert ice cream was terrible. They only served those cheap local ice cream in chocolate, strawberry and yam flavour. Do not expect premium gelato quality ice cream here. Surprised a 5 star Hilton hotel serves this kind of ice cream... Shangrila and Mandarin Oriental all serve premium gelato quality ice creams at their buffets.Lastly, parking is super expensive here. We parked for less than 2 hours, and it was RM15. When settling the bill, we gave our parking tickets for validation, but the waiter said it's a flat rate today (Saturday), so no validation is necessary. I think RM15 flat rate for 1 hour plus of parking is ridiculous. We had 2 cars at our table so the parking fee was RM30, which in my opinion is very expensive. Even parking in hotels in the middle of KL city is much cheaper, normally around RM8 for 2 hours of parking, their restaurant dining flat rates are also around RM8, certainly not RM15.Conclusion, poor service, mediocre food, and expensive parking... do not waste your time here.Show less",1,Reviewed 17 August 2013 ,Paya Serai

RicphunSg petani,Came hungry and left without eating much,"We were having a pharmaceutical talk on 13th of April, 2013 that was held in the hotel by a well known drug manufacturing company and the talk finished about 8.30 pm. Dinner was arranged by the drug company at the Paya Serai that serves buffet style. Being a 5 stars hotel, of course we were delighted to have dinner there and we happily went there. There was less then 100 of us and there were other dinners that were there so I would say they got a good crowd all most full house. We got to the tables seated and started the first round of food by the group. When I reached the fresh sea food behind about 10 people the shrimps or prawns were all snapped up. Well ok, its a Hilton, we thought they will refill so we ate other things which not really a good variety. Soon even the satay corner people were lining up waiting and the best part is some satay looks raw to me and they were being served, I guess there were a lot of hungry people even that were snapped up. Then finally shrimps were refilled so I managed to get about 10 pieces and all snapped up again. So I enjoyed my shrimps and finished hoping to get another helping but no refill time again, tiring of waiting I ask a staff and should be a senior staff as he wears the black coat to my surprise he told me that they were out of shrimps. Well too bad went back to my table they were 8 of us and 6 of them said they didn't even got a chance to eat even one shrimp so I gave up and went for desserts and the ice cream texture is like soft cream served at Mc Donnalds which means the ice box was not working well to keep the ice cream firm.So in the end the only conclusion we had was well its normal for buffet to keep food ratio of 30 paxs to a 100 paxs capacity so that more profits for the outlet as in buffets we pay per head count and if you didn't eat much that's not their problem.Show less",1,Reviewed 15 April 2013 ,Paya Serai

"izilhizamShah Alam, Malaysia",Definitely a carnivore‚Äôs haven üëçüèº,"Both the wagyu & prime brisket was tender & succulent, and the house barbeque sauce was outstanding. The prime ribs flesh falls apart from the bone, and so flavourful, however it was slightly cold when it arrives our table (we reckon it would taste even better if it was warmer). The pulled lamb was another good dish we would recommend anyone, tender and full of flavour, however we would prefer if the tortilla accompanying it to be toasted a little bit more to have that charred taste. As for the chicken, you can really taste the smokiness all through the flesh and the rub on the chicken skin is really tasty. The only minor let-down for us, is the rosemary lamb, which we thought is lacking in portion size and tasted a bit dry (maybe because the lamb was not very thick). All in all, all my friends was really satisfied and we will definitely come back for another visit.Show less",4,Reviewed 17 August 2018 ,Karnivormalaya

It was relatively quiet when we visited - probably because it was still during the chinese new year holidays - so we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.My children enjoyed their meals. We had both the local and western dishes and it did not dissappoint. The dishes were full of flavor. The curry laksa was thick and creamy. The broth of the noodle soup was rich. The penang laksa was served with a full spoon of otak udang which i loved! This is an essential ingredient which one cannot live without when eating penang laksa! The laksa gravy was full of fish flavor and the cafe was not stingy on the condiments. The carbonara was rich and full of mushrooms - just how a mushroom carbonara should be - and the pizza had all the italian flavors. Nice! The appetizer of toasted bread along with the dipping condiments was delicious.We were too stuffed to try the full dessert spread but the pancakes and churros ice cream did not disappoint. Will be coming by for the cakes and fried durians on our next visit. The crew member that waited on us was friendly and helpful with his menu suggestions. It is very pleasant being served by someone who knows their products. The cafe ambience is very welcoming. Comfortable seating area and there is also seperate dining area should u wish toake reservations for a private function. Will definitely come back - plenty more in the menu which we have not tasted. Looking forward to trying more! So glad the cafe is almost right at my door step. Show less",4,Reviewed 4 February 2017 ,Tanah Aina Cafe

It was also a nice portion which means you wont be wasting food nor are you going to be left wanting for more. So thumbs up to the chef and owner for being considerate in this meal. The salted egg yolk chicken chop was served with a nice portion of the gravy and was not overpowering as what you might think when it comes to salted egg yolk.

The vege was so sour none of us could even swallow even the meatballs was so salty like a whole pack of salt poured into the meatball. We gave our comments and they brush it off with next time you can ask for less spicy, etc. But the main thing we pointed out it was so salty, we asked them to even taste it themselves. We are fine to pay it but they are unable to take critism at all pointing out this is how Pakistani cuisine is like. FYI one of us who was eating with us HAVE been to Pakistan and lived there and this no near any Pakistani food.

The decor was upscale and befitting a diner, and the menu has an array of exciting sounding delicacies that we were not acquainted with (like south american dishes). I picked lamb with fig jam while my wife chose spring chicken with tangy salad. The lamb was tender and cooked just nice so appear medium rare, and sliced and stacked between a loaf of baguette; the fig jam came in a separate porcelain container. The spring roast chicken sat on a bed of cauliflower and broccoli, with diced potatoes and black pepper sauce. Perhaps my choice of fig jam was rather hasty as i love figs; the sweet sauce did not do justice to the lamb. As for the spring chicken, it was a healthy dish but not too exciting to the taste. Overall, it was ok but for the price, we expected something better. Will return for the other items on the menu with their exotic names; the sole dessert, ice cream burger looked tempting (ice cream scoop in a donut) but no thanks, we have to avoid sweet stuff. Lastly the drinks: my wife had pineapple juice while i ordered hot mocha.

I passED the other half of the sandwich to my friend and a big piece of sharp bone fell on the plate, it sounded like a stone dropping on it. We were done by this point.

"FoodEnthusedKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Didn't enjoy the meal,"Walking into the outlet, you would be drawn to the hip and creative interior and deco that is very pig-centric! The menu is also very porky in range and not for everyone. The outlet came across as very ambitious with elements of commercialism and branding much like Naughty Nuri's. But that's where the similarities end. The menu is big and confusing. If you took time to actually go through it, you will realise that they are merely repetition of the same porky items with different carb choices. While the server was helpful, there was a lot of flipping around the pages before we finally decided what to order. We had the pulled pork pasta and the signature BBQ pork ribs. The latter tasted strongly of gula melaka, which was salty sweet without being too cloying. We liked that it wasn't exactly fall off the bone as other establishments, and had a solid bite to it. The pasta was a big disappointment as the pulled pork, starchy and too sweet, was clumsily slopped over soggy, tasteless over-cooked pasta. It reminded us of eating in British university hall food! Not in a good way. However the fries we shared were tasty and addictive.Service was pleasant and enthusiastic.

One of the hard bones located was at least 3cm in length, which can be quite dangerous. Presentation wise, could be better, but still quite decent in its own ways. However.

Quick to help and serve with a smile. However, there was a small little error during ordering, which lead to the junior waitress in entering the wrong order.

The ribs are good with a sweetish glaze, half an order gets you three ribs with a full order getting you six. The rest of the menu basically is pork cooked in different styles (try the meatballs! They're amazing!) with your choice of rice, spaghetti or bread. For a more decadent experience, add fried pork lard to your rice/spaghetti! However, I would recommend against adding cheese as you would have to pay a few ringgit extra for them to simply slap a slice of cheese on top of the rice/spaghetti - not very presentable or tasty as you don't get enough cheese covering anything.

TRW is definitely not the best restaurant in Petaling Jaja, as currently rated. This is a BBQ joint and nice as such, food is tasty but nothing super spectacular. You will find this type and quality of food in thousands of other places so no need to make the trip here if you have one closer to your home.Pork is the thing here and you will get it in various versions. I tried the signature ribs, a full bucket of the spicier version, and also the pulled leg sandwich. The sandwich was just ok, relatively neutral in taste and as such a harmless filling to your stomach. The full bucket of the signature spicy ribs were a bigger disappointment, as only one third of them were actual ribs. The rest were end-pieces, mostly bone and very little meat. This part they should definitely not serve as ribs. Accompanying this I got the sloppy garlic and I do not recommend it as a side dish. I just don't get the dish, big bowl of garlic blended in sauce and cheese (I think)... looks to me as something for people who just want to fill their stomach with something.

The pork is really soft, the one I like most is the Lazy Bone, just chew a few times and that's it, the pork will melt in your mouth.

juz_do_itKuala Lumpur,Expensive and nothing out of the ordinary ribs,"Why are BBQ pork ribs in Klang Valley sooooo expensive? Pork is a lot cheaper than beef in Malaysia yet the eat pork dishes at restaurants can set you back a serioooous bit. K, first thing, the place is creatively decorated. From the front entrance, as you walk in, there are a few great artistic work here that'll make you smile and even chuckle. On all the walls there are quirky murals that'll get you tickled for sure. As for the food, specifically the ribs, they didn't tickle us. When you think of BBQ ribs, I bet you're picturing a slab of succulent, tenderest, meatiest pork ribs, slathered with sweet hickory sauce right ? Yup, that's my idea of a rack of baby pork ribs along with sides of a salad and roasted potato.It's not like that here. The ribs are short and small portioned, served in a tin canister. As if that's not bad enough, they're are reeeeally thin on the meat too. You could say, ""where's the meat?"" Trust me, you won't get that satisfying bite into those pork ribs. Taste wise, they are just OK, definitely, nothing spectacular. Everything is served on waxed paper. You have to add on the sides. My pasta noodles came PLAIN...just salted. No spices...nothing. That was RM5. You want want minced pork over the noodles, it's extra charge.In the end, if you added up the sides and drinks plus the small sized mains, your bill will be hefty. If you like to pay for ambience and cute decor, this is one of the more interesting places I've seen. For the world of me, I don't know why this restaurant is packed with so many youngsters.....clearly, youngsters who can really spend. I really wish the owner had swooned us with the food, rather than invest so much on making the restaurant such a hip joint.Click on Images when you google Ticklish Ribs Seapark - the menu, those teeny, tiny ribs in the canisters, photos of the restaurant are all there.Show less",3,Reviewed 16 August 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

Instead of taking my order and processing it right away, I had to queue up at the counter to pay.I'm not saying that this is an abnormal practice in modern day caf√©s nowadays, but seeing as there's already not much space for walking around, I don't think having your customers take up space standing in line to pay is a good idea. I lined up, only to find that that's not the designated queue up line. To make matters worse, I had to wait doubly long since the cashier prioritized other patrons and let them pay before me. Just as I thought it's not going to be a good day, the ribs turned it around. It was awesome as recommended.

Non-spicy came dry and some part burnt. Really pathetic cuts of meat and really small portion. Spicy was a lot better, tender, juicy and a much better cut. And they really do mean spicy. Ordered the fried pork with bun. FML, even a sandwich at Subway could be considered 10 times better than what we got. Pathetic thin slice of something (I could not identify it as meat) with some onions, green pepper and lettuce. Honestly we left this place wanting to wash it down with a Ramly burger. It was horribly bland. And the add-on salad? More onions, green pepper and lettuce in a tiny bowl. Can't believe I paid RM10 for this.

However, their spicy version is rather mild and lack of hotness. A place worth a return visit.Show less",4,Reviewed 25 March 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

"Karen Joyce BPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",READ MY REVIEW WHY...,"We always go out and try new places for foodventure. I saw this place last year with my family and finally got the chance to try it this month. We had other places in mind, but since this was the only interesting place open during that time, we went for it. So here it goes.. Interior is fun and playful. You could tell from the moment you enter the door that this place is for people who drink (alcohol) and eat at the same time. I met the manager and she was helpful and entertaining. She explained the menu to us and that made it easier for us to order. I asked what are the best sellers. She immediately recommended their signature ribs. We also ordered Hoilam Ting with Rice and Got Balls with Pasta. We received the Hoilam Ting first, followed by the ribs. I waited for more than 20 minutes for my meal, to find out that she forgot about it. After 5-8mins, my food arrived. Here are my feedback about the food: Okay, signature ribs. That's their signature ribs, it was okay. What a rib should be. It was more sweet than BBQ to me. But hey, that's their signature recipe. I'm fine with it. What I don't like though, for 3 pieces it's RM22! Next, the Hoilam Ting. It's my first time to try something like that. It was like eating pork and beans. It was too sweet and daaaamn, the rice! The rice was too dry! You know it's not good quality. Lastly, the GOT Balls. Few pieces of balls and too much pasta! I didn't even like the pasta. I was so disappointed. For me, personally, if I have a restaurant that fun-looking, I'm going to make sure that every single thing that comes out of that kitchen is good quality. The noodles were made for soup. Shame.. The got balls won't be appreciated because of the cheap pasta. If ever I come back, I'm going to try the sandwich. Definitely going to try that! Wait for it guys!

"17ValenciaKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Paradigm Shift in Taste,"If you are expecting pork ribs seasoned in traditional BBQ sauce, you will be charmed by surprises! If you are expecting crispy fries to be served, you will be amazed with the opposite! If you think only baby back ribs can offer the tenderness, you will be convinced otherwise in Ticklish!It was my family's first visit and we ordered the signature BBQ ribs (The Ultimate Tickle), sloppy fries topped with minced pork, pork sandwich with charcoal bread, salad (zzzalad) and drinks. When I bit the ribs, I was surprised that the meat was marinated with Asian spice which had no hint of BBQ sauce flavor which I was accustomed from other Western style rib shops. Result? I, my wife and 2 children loved it!! And the meat was very tender even though the rib bone were big. The pork sandwich tasted very similar to Chinese's ""Dongpo"" Pork Êù±Âù°ËÇâ (d≈çng p≈ç r√≤u) style plus mixed raw onion and green vegetables - a fusion sandwich which I ordered another one after the first was snatched up fast! Sloppy Fries was actually a topping of Chinese spice marinated minced meat over the crispy fries which made it soggy but appetizing! It was a paradigm shift with the way one eats fries. Again, I repeated my order as it was real good! Salad was nothing special and no point ordering unless you needed some green to go along with meaty food.

We also had bottomless drinks included, and sadly, we found ants in our Sprite. Now, that was a bad way to end this meal... And all this cost a total of RM78 for two people.

The pasta and rice dishes are good too. Owners came and check on us to get our feedback and very friendly. Only thing is that portion is a tad small and big eaters might need to order 2 servings.

The menu is well intended and they stick with their humor that works well. It does require a bit of culinary knowledge to understand what meat type you are ordering (ribs, pork belly, pulled pork, pork loin, pork thigh). I like how the design and execution is well thought through. From the door sign warning Non halal people to the piggies on the wall this is a fun joint. The portion are small by western sizes but then the prices are descent. BBQ takes time and this is hand made and not subway frozen stuff. Pork ribs:Fantastic spiced marinade. The do fall of the bone with is what many like. I personally like a bit of chew but that's preference. They use a combi oven to give them nice crisp charring. The spice is at first a bit overpowering but their Asian BBQ sauce with nice ginger is helping that. The non spicy version is definitely missing something. Pork belly:This was my least favorite. It's braised but dry in the meat and the fat did not render as the heat was too low. Finishing it over a hot grill would do wonders to it. The marinade is tasty. Blackened porn loin:Very tasty, soy ginger Lemongrass marinade. It goes under in a sandwich and is best served over the fantastic pork lard ginger rice!Marinated pork thigh:This was my favorite. Yummy, fresh and good on sandwiches. Very well done fusion. The sloppy fries are nearly a poutine and quite nice. The pasta is a bit bland but as TC(owner) mentioned in another review here it's hard to please everybody. Some like soft some like al dente but don't come here for pasta so get the awesome rice instead!The staff is super friendly and the manager took a good10minutes of her time to chat with me about the food and listened to my critique.

"RSCheokSingapore, Singapore","Good ribs, not as cheap as it appears","I went on a weekday lunch and it was quite empty. We ordered 2 items, the boneless ribs with rice (Lazy Bones Rm22) and the breaded pork on rice (Rice Vice RM12).Both were nice - the rice was soft and fluffy, the ribs were nice and tasty, the breaded pork and egg were also good. Problem was that the quantity of pork for RM22 seemed very little, probably about 2 tablespoons full (likely to be from 2 ribs). I suppose prices are already nett so not too bad. The pork on the rice vice was also quite thin (this was RM12 so I did not expect more),Service was not exactly friendly and they only take cash.So, good place, but it was a bit underwhelming overall.Show less",4,Reviewed 28 October 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

You can also add on fried egg, onion, cheese...etc. Portion are just right for an individual. order and pay at the counter then they will deliver to your table. I personally like their pork ball (Got balls- that's the name) served in charcoal bun. What surprised me was they put Chee-yau-cha (deep fried pork lard) in it as well. It soooo delicious!!!!

The idea of self-customized meals is creative and together with the quirky and creative interior, this place serves as a great attraction to the younger generation.However, it isn't outstanding when it comes to the flavors. I had the grilled pork fillet sandwich at the price of MYR 15. The portion is relatively small as compared to other major sandwich chains such as Subway and Quiznos for a similar price. The grilled pork fillets taste bland and the sweet and sour sauce just could not make the cut.

At first glance the menu looks complicated but the servers are on hand to give you a run thru on how it works!We ordered a bucket of The Spicy and The Not So Much ribs to share for 4 ladies. The unanimous agreement was that the Spicy version was more tasty. Love the flavours and how the meat just fell off the bones!The next thing that blew our tastebuds away was the sloppy fries! We love this so so much! It was like a party in the mouth! Couldn't stop reaching for more. I'd happily eat this all day!!

"Lin LSan Francisco, California",In the mood for Ribs? This is the only place to go!!,"So, I'm back on holiday from the States where I've been living for almost 20 years now. And I always go for the local fare. But my girl was in the mood for ribs - born in America, what - so we headed to this new place. First off - it's not big. I'm guesstimating 30-40 seats? But that's how I like my dining experience so that's a plus. And the decor is amazing! The walls are mural-ed and you'll never mistake it for a vegetarian restaurant. Cute pigs everywhere.You walk up to the counter to order. The menu - super imaginative! Dishes like ChewBakKwa (sandwich made with bak kwa. See what they did there?) and You Braise Me Up (so I can savor the yummy slow cooked streaky pork). Even the drinks, aka lubricants, come in 'Going soft' or 'Like it harder'. On that note, to be clear - the restaurant is very family friendly. My daughter is 16 and found the menu giggle worthy and quite clever. It'll go over the heads of younger ones. Who will love the decorations on the walls. And the unique service slide. I've never seen this anywhere else. Food is cooked in the back kitchen and when ready, sent in trays down a slide, where it gets picked up by the servers and brought to your table. Fantastic idea - keeps the need for servers walking through the space to a minimum and is an eye-catching feature.Preamble aside...crux of any restaurant review...how was the food? 1 word - Yummylicious! 2 words - Must return. In fact, we ate there twice more in the two weeks we were back. The recipe for the ribs is a closely guarded secret and made off-site by only 2-3 people. The sauce is to die for and seriously finger-licking good. We'll definitely be back again. In addition, I really liked that the management is giving back to the community - they had, very unobtrusively, some mugs for sale - made by youths with learning disabilities with all sales proceeds going to that foundation. The mugs weren't in your face at all and the servers don't push them but my goodness - they are adorable. Slightly larger than espresso size, with snouts at the bottoms.Bottom line - we had a wonderful dining experience here. Ambiance and food were excellent and we look forward to returning.Show less",5,Reviewed 29 August 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches
"KelvinHuangSingapore, null, Singapore",Absolutely delicious!,"We've read stellar reviews about Ticklish despite being from out of town, and finally managed to eat there last night. We ordered half a bucket of Signature BBQ Ribs, a Pull Your Leg wholemeal sandwich and a Ssshock Sendiri with rice. We loved all the dishes, especially the fragrant pork lard rice. The pork ribs had a drop-off-the-bone quality to it, and was flavourfully marinated, while the battered pork struck the right balance of being crispy but not too dry. The service was top-notch, and we suspect that the friendly, humble man who attended to us was the owner himself. My parents, who are from Penang, invited him to start an outlet there so that they don't have to come all the way to Petaling Jaya to enjoy the ribs at Ticklish.

I circled Seapark more than 12 times to get a parking space. My friends were waiting for me already inside. The jam was horrid. Nevertheless i was cheesed.Then I came in, 90% of the menu was out. I was angry, hungry and disappointed. So I paid, got myself a bottle of Guinness to numb my pain from the hectic week and waited the next 30min for my food. The numbers called skipped my number. I don't know how the numbers work so i was annoyed that my number was skipped and my friends are already half way to their wiches. Added more points to anger. After another 5minutes I was already raging, hungry, depressed and irritated in all kind of senses you can think of. Then my number rang and i went to get my meatball sandwich and ribs.Skeptic. I told the bread in my hands that 'You better be worth the wait' and tore the wrapping half way through and took a bite.That fried lard. Them balls. Them sauce. Them bread. Them sin. Them pork.THEM RIBS. THEM SAUCE. THEM CRACKLING SPICE. THEM FALLING OFF BONE GOODNESS.HOW DARE YOU serve such good meals. HOW DARE YOU open in a place with insufficient parking spaces. HOW DARE YOU run out of porky goodness at almost end of the day. HOW DARE YOU.I take everything back.It was so good. My mood instantly lifted. It was SO GOOD; the wait, the rage, the frustration seemed like a nose booger that was never a problem residing in your deepest darkest nasal canals. The sandwich was so good, it was SO SO GOOD.

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",HOMST did not deliver,"Homst Chinese Muslim restaurant boasts of chinese cooking but at our latest visit, we barely detected the chinese in the food we ordered.Malaysian yes but chinese?Let's start with radish cake. Traditionally fried like char kway teow, this one came in chilied cubes on a bed of beansprouts. Nothing like the one you get in a genuine chinese restaurant like Dodo for example.Next is the sizzling taufu: when served the sizzle had gone and we beheld a large pan of spicy sauce where egg and taufu were swimming in. The taufu was sparsely spread, giving the impression there was not enough to go around in a crowded restaurant.But it was the taste that made us conclude that this is more a Malaysian than chinese restaurant. Chinese cooking is distinguished by the freshness; food here looked lethargic as if the kitchen was not enthusiastic enough or perhaps the chinese chef is taking a break.And we passed up on dim sum deciding it would be better to wait for an occasion to celebrate at Chynna where one finds the best dim sum in town.One can get a decent Malaysian meal here but we wish the chinese style is not too compromised to cater to those who are not too particular. We left knowing why tourists bypass the local pizza chain as the italian pizza served is anything but.Show less",2,Reviewed 20 December 2020 ,Homst

Other dishes ordered were braised pork leg in claypot, stir fried vegetable, fried soya noodles, and ginger fried with fish cutlets.The Loh Mee is good, but may not be the best. The reason is every eatery in Hulu Yam seems to be doing the same thing. So, taste is depends on individual and subjective.As for fried soya noodles, it is good, but soya noodles does not absorb gravy well, hence it is dry. Maybe should have ordered the same but using vermicelli instead.Fish cutlet fried with ginger is really good and well done, and the braised pork leg in claypot is just okay.Overall is okay, as in palatable.

The char siu buns were great so we ordered another one. For the non-steamed ones, most are already pre-cooked and placed inside a food warmer. This works for some dishes but definitely not the deep fried ones like the ""wu kok"" aka deep fried yam dumplings. This dish arrived lukewarm and so wasn't very enjoyable. My brother who joined the table later wanted some wu kok and so I requested the waitress to bring us a freshly made hot batch, and thankfully she did. It tasted a whole lot better. I can understand the food warmer reasoning to ensure demand is met during rush hour but certain dishes must be made fresh to order.To finish off we ordered some egg tarts. I found them tasty, not too sweet with crumbly pastry just how I like it. Most dishes are around $5.50 mark.

Some said that when one think of pandan layer cake, one think of Regent. Not sure how true is that.. but even my clerk told me that she had heard of this shop before when I bought her the cake.The story started when my dad was craving for bah kut teh & initially I'd planned to buy the famous Ah Her Bah Kut Teh in Klang. I ended up in Klang and decided to head to Regent to buy some cakes for my mom who's a huge fan of pandan. Regent Pandan Layer Cake Shop is legendary - many people drive all the way to Klang just for their pandan layer cake. As you reach this rather deserted area (this area used to be thriving but now all you can see is its past glory), just park your car and walk-in to be greeted by fridges filled with green and purple coloured cakes. Green is of course pandan while purple is yam layer cakes. It comes in various sizes to choose from. I bought quite a lot of pandan layer cake (should have bought yam cake as well) for my mom and her friends. Apart from that they also sell other cakes such as marble, chocolate, etc... the owner had planned to close the business once but somehow kept on operating. If you love pandan layer cake, do try it as soon as possible before it's closed for good.Show less",4,Reviewed 27 February 2019 ,Regent Pandan Layer Cake Shop

DavidY2503,Mom's Corner!,"My family and I have been eating Aunty Parames' food for as long as I can remember. The reason being that firstly, the food here is really at the top in terms of taste and quality in comparison with any other Indian restaurant out there and it has stayed that way for over 20 years! (That's how long I've been going there) Secondly, Aunty Parames, simply put, is an angel! The food that comes out, is made that much better because of the heart that she puts into her food. Recommend that you go for the mutton varuval and pal appam! I still haven't tasted better in any other place!

"haneeakadirSubang Jaya, Malaysia",Dissapointing Food,"Went there yesterday night and ordered their salmon and beef burger which was amongst their recommended items on their menu. I had a whole imagination in my mind of how exciting my plate would looked like with the text description on the menu. But alas, this was one of the time where I felt the most letdown with the food served. I took the salmon with grilled tiger prawn served on mashed potato and vege with creamy lobster sauce. Now tell me if it doesnt excite your palate. What I got was not fresh grilled prawn and not properly cleaned, very bad mashed potato with no taste to any flavor. The star was supposed to be the salmon which was chargrilled but served in together with wet stir fried vege which took out the crispiness of the salmon skin. Then to top it off, there was way too much tomato in the creamy lobster sauce which was not creamy at all that totally killed any taste of the salmon. And to top it off, they served all these in a pasta plate rather than a flat one which left no room for one to enjoy each bit of the meal without mushing them in the mashed potato. The beef burger was the unexpected letdown. First off, it did not taste of fresh patties for the price that they are charging. Then, the fries were not even cooked properly. Who can screw up frying fries?In short, great place, great ambience, great service but seriously, please change your chef. Show less",1,Reviewed 24 April 2017 ,Twenty & Co

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Not to my expectations,"Perhaps my expectations was unnecessarily high or maybe the restaurant was having an 'off-day' but all I can say is that I was disappointed. I walked in and followed the usual covid-19 protocols. I ordered the ayam-goreng berempah, with the additional pineapple sambal with an iced tea, kurang manis. I paid upfront rm27.90 I think and found my table. The iced tea arrived in a wonderful copper mug allowing it to be kept cold for a longer period. Unfortunately the tea was terrible. It was unbelievably light that one could hardly taste the tea. And of course it was too sweet!!!!I took it back and told them the problem and requested that they add more black tea to it. My nasi lemak arrived a bit later, but without the pineapple sambal. The usual sambal was there, in an extremely small jar. Certainly insufficient for a plate of nasi lemak. But I preferred to wait for the former. And waited. And waited some more. I walked up to the counter and enquired of it and the reply was that 'she' was making it. On closer inspection I noticed that 'she' was prepping other plates of food. I asked her when would the pineapple sambal be ready?? She wasnt happy with the question and walked away in a huff.Oh! Well. I walked back and began to tuck in. The chicken was disappointing. It was more KFC styled, albeit darker but without the supposed 'rempah'. I think a proper marinade would be in order. Much of the chicken was left unfinished. No complaints about the ikan bilis, nuts, cucumber and the egg. The pineapple sambal finally arrived. Similarly to the chicken, pieces of pineapple are added to a random sambal. Without pineapple pulp or pineapple juice added to the sambal. So it isn't truly a pineapple sambal. Adding apple chunks to sambal would not similarly make it an apple sambal. I think you can see where I'm going with this.So overall it was a disappointing visit.

I had to send it back thrice I ordered medium and it came back thrice raw. And not even edible raw completely raw. I love raw steaks as well.

The waiters don't even take your order you have to get up and beg for them to come to your table. We asked for fresh juices with ice and they put extra ice.

The manager promised me six minutes and exactly six minutes later, my dish came. Now you may wonder why this warrant a review on TA, a chef who can't seem to get a simple burger right.

The worst thing was the immense heat emanating from the 3 massive saucepans holding the Briyani rice. I had never sweat so much while standing still!!!When they finally began taking orders it was incredibly slow. The order-takers were also packers and they also calculated the cost. This made the line move at an unbelievably slow pace (while still sweating like a pig). Added to this was the irritating way everyone working would stop what they were doing to attend to random problems.

Food did not disappoint...in fact we enjoyed our dinner very much. We had the typical appetizers to start our meal. Nachos and the chilli were yummy. The lamb shank was not quite up to expectations because the server told us their lamb shank was very good. It was tasty but not as good as another lam shank we have tried-it didnt ""melt-in-the-mouth"" and the meat did not ""fall off the bone"". The steaks were up to expectations and the doneness was as ordered. That's a very good thing because most restaurants cant it quite right. We were too full for dessert but will definitely save room for it the next time we are there. Yes, we intend to go back to this restaurant.

"thefoodwizardKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Hearty fuss-free Mexican food,"A rare trip to Subang Taipan for some banking chores randomly brought us to this charming Mexican restaurant. The interior was a little kitschy but it felt cozy and inviting, with sufficient Mexican accents to keep it in theme. Charming!If I had to sum up the meal, it was hearty and tasty. The ingredients may not be as refined and authentic as La Mexicana but at a price range with most dishes well under RM30, it's more than decent.The mussels were a great start; the thick, creamy broth with fresh cilantro and habanero doubled equally good as a soup. I liked the thoughtfulness of the folded tortillas; perfect for soaking up the bowl of deliciousness. If they had been toasted slightly, even better.The seared marks on the charbroiled sole was a good indication of the rustic smokey flavours that followed. The fish retained its succulence and the flavours were light, yet rich. I am still contemplating if the baked potato was really necessary.Chili con corne was next, it was hard to resist checking out this classic Tex-Mex dish. It passed with flying colours. Old school yumminess. Love the fluffiness of the rice and the meaty chilli stew was lip-smacking. A personal preference - a bit more heat would have been perfect.Overall, the food is good enough to warrant a repeat visit.

Naturally, I requested for more & the waiter then mentioned that they will need to charge for the extra. Really?

The mural are very colourful so that gives the place a lively look.Besides the regular Mexican fare of fajitas, burritos, etc you can also choose the standard grilled meats and fish and pastas. Their choice of drinks are of the standard fare just as you would get in any Western restaurant. They seem to have limited choices in their dessert section. We had dinner here a couple of days ago for a birthday celebration. The service was good. I tried their chicken burritos which was delightful. The Virgin Colada was refreshing although the same drink served at another Mexican restaurant in Pavilion was much better. Price of a meal and drink is between RM40-50 per pax.

Shennanigens,Food made up for the blemishes,"Was going to give the place a 3 rating, mainly as we walked into then place, the table we were given was not well cleaned, and when asked, the waiter did a half hearted job of it, and we had to ask again. When we went the Eid buffet was on, and when we asked the head waiter (assume he was the head as he was the only one with a black suite) if they would replenish as some of the dishes were close to empty, we got a gruff no, he then re composed and asked the boss and said he would make small dishes for us if we wanted something that finished. They in the end did not bring us the paneer, but we did get the chicken and garlic naan. So a bit miffed by the service, but there were plusses, 2 of the waiters were very nice and attentive, the place though a bit dull, was cozy and we had a good corner to ourselves to manage our 3 little terrors ‚ò∫.

That day I had, for the first time in my life, what they called fried asam laksa. Technically it is asam laksa without the broth and they fried the lai fun with asam laksa sauce.

The quintessential cockles were present so everything's good. ‚óæfried asam laksa - simply put it, I love this dish.. you'd find most of the flavour and asam laksa ingredients in this plate plus prawns & bean sprout akin to char kuey teow. I simply squeezed the lime juice and mixed everything together before slurping away. The price is kept relatively affordable because this is a student area after all and the market is too big to be ignored.

So how do they fare in a food delivery service?Service: We placed the order via a third party app which was pretty straight forward.Packaging: They arrived in pretty standard take-away boxesDukkah Spiced Grilled Chicken (RM 32)The grilled chicken was nicely spiced slightly moist within and sat upon a bed of garden fresh greens. The mushrooms were crunchy and topped with a slight drizzle of walnuts. The dressing gave the dish a slightly sweet and salty touch.Recommended? Sure! It was refreshing and flavourfulGarlic Butter Lobster with Salted Egg Spaghetti (RM 58)The pasta was cooked al Dante with a very rich and buttery salted egg sauce which continually seduced us scoop after scoop. Unfortunately, the lobster meat was slightly mushy but had a beautiful layer of melted cheese on top with a pinch of chilli flakes giving the dish a very slight spicy edge. This was finished with a downpour of aromatic herbs.Recommended? Although it would have been better had the lobster been a little more fresh, but no doubt still a flavourful dishWatermelon Cake (RM 19.50)Pioneers in the watermelon gastronomical scene, we had high hopes from the beginning and true enough, we were not disappointed. The base of the cake was rich and creamy with a slice of juicy watermelon. Each layer had a very smooth texture to it. Although the top had chopped strawberries, lychee and grapes, the cake was not overpoweringly sweet. It was very refreshing and a great way to end the mealRecommended?

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Pretty good pavlova,My sweet tooth takes me far and wide and this time to Naj Belle. They call it deconstructed pavlova. I think it is impt to note that the pavlova itself is good. Many other kitchens use too much cream and that really bloats you up. Secondly some others tend to use grapes (it is cheaper i suppose) but the juice from the fruit tend to seep and destroy the sugar. At Naj this does not happen as there are no grapes. Just strawberries. Some raspberries would be nice though. And theres just the right amount of cream. So it is much better than the one at Serai. I should point out that they may be a tad misguided on the term 'deconstructed' as what they have done is merely taken the entire cake apart and served it deconstructed! If you're looking at it from a construction point of view its fine but it is not true to form. Of course i could be nitpicking! Show less,4,Reviewed 20 May 2017 ,Naj & Belle

Attended their wine matching dinner event recently, whereby chef Shiomi-san, matches the food with the wines pretty harmoniously. However, was a little disappointed this time because the wagyu A3 was over-cooked thus became really tough - didn't finish the wagyu dine. Shiomi-San is a talented cook and believe this minor slip-up was because of the group dining with 22 pax. As he is the only cook and he single-handedly cooked the whole dinner, hence overwhelmed with the task, which resulted in the mistake. The management has to take note and rectify the situation by hiring a sous-chef to support him. Overall, it was a poor experience, however wouldn't be disturb by this experience and will continue to frequent this place.

Calvin L,A typical family restaurant,"Decided to check out this 4 star Google rated restaurant. Firstly when you get there, parking will be a problem, as it's Subang! The service was prompt as there was someone that greeted us a the door and quickly got us a seat. The crowd was a mix of family and young working adults.We ordered the chawanmushi and the the one with crab meat and sharks fin as well. The regular chawanmushi was really bad as the eggs felt overcooked and hard. The crab meat one tastes much better with more well cooked eggs but it costs RM10 more. The Unagi that we ordered was rubbery and not well grilled. Slightly below average as I was expecting more , as it costs RM50. Rakuzen definitely wins in the area. The rice was hard and unappetising, topped with not so savoury gravy as well.The fish skin was nice on the first bite and not after, maybe it's the oil that feels that it has been reused and not fresh. Thee tempuras here are slightly flacid and the yasai tempura is over cooked and slightly charred but it's a full Nepalese team that's cooking it, not Japanese or locals so you can expect much for quality. The salmon sashimi I would say is good value for money as you get 7 slices for RM25, which is very decent however, 3 belly slices and 4 slices of God knows which part of the fish. At least they provide freshly grated wasabi so that was good. The overall experience was ok, as service was prompt and would definitely be good as a family type of Restaurant.

"Tina TKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Satisfying!,"From its coffeeshop beginnings in Singapore (2000), it is now a 23-outlet chain that serves foodies across the region. Along the way, it also picked up a michelin star and a few other culinary awards, So, does the food live up to all this hype?Putien takes it name from Putian, a coastal town in the Fujian province. On its website, it promises to ""deliver only the most unadulterated tastes, the most heartwarming, sincere service and a gastronomical experience so enjoyable that it will always hold a place in your heart.""It specialises in Heng Hwa cuisine and presents a rather unusual take on chinese food. Among its signature dishes are Iced Abalone, Iced Bitter Gourd and Drunken Cockles - all of which I plan to savour on my next visit.This time however, Dad wasn't feeling so adventurous so we had the Stir-Fried Chilli Live Clams (super tasty with a good portion of ""kuah"" - gravy), Sweet and Sour Pork (I would have been happier if the morsels of meat retained its deep-fried crunch, but otherwise it was ok), Bian Rou Soup with vinegar (little wanton parcels in a slightly tangy, sour soup - good stuff!) and Fried Heng Hwa Beehoon (description sounded tastier than the dish itself, but the noodles were indeed fine. Perhaps the louder flavours from the other dishes overpowered this choice).The bill came to about RM80 (which included two glasses of warm water and a bowl of steamed white rice - RM2.20). The restaurant was packed - it was a Saturday night. I'm looking forward to savouring the rest of its enticing menu, especially their Top Ten.Then only will I be able to tell if the hype is real.Show less",4,Reviewed 20 June 2018 ,Putien

Riding on the one Michelin Star award, this is one of their outlets, in Subang Jaya, Selangor.Located on thr 1st floor inside SS15 Courtyard, which is very easy to find them. the shop front is really nice and grand looking.. Even when you walk in too feels grand, where the waiters and waitresses will greet in unison.The receiving staff at the front entrance will usher to a table.We were given the pictured and described menu, and were given some time to look through to choose.Immediately, one of the waiter came with the tidbits, 2 types to be exact.The captain came by to take our orders and we ordered, She does upsell and recommend their signature dishes.Ordered their Cabbage soup, Bamboo Herbal Prawn soup, fried Bee hoon, Lor mee, Cabbage rice. As usual, when going to chinese meal, Chinese tea is a must. The captain recommended 2 types to choose, Xiang Pian and Da Hong Pao. We opted for Dao Hong Pao, which is served in per cup per head basis.The tea came per cup per head, where inside the cup is a ceramic strainer for the tea leaves. the waiter who served the tea brought a like a tiny hour glass. That is to time to let the tea to brew, which is not for long, say a couple of minutes. Each cup of tea is served with a smaller cup, which is for us to put the strainer with the leaves. The strainer can be taken out and drink the tea from the main cup itself. Hot water can be refilled.The order is served. Even though it is small portion, but they are really filling.The Bamboo Herbal Prawn soup is served in a bamboo container, which is good for 1 person. This soup is really tasty, which comes with 2 prawns in each serving. We ordered 2 of this soup.The cabbage soup too is really good, which has a few pieces of beancurd and some seafood and meat in it. Their fried bee hoon is really good with seafood like clams. Cabbage rice is nice too. Their Lor Mee is something different. Unlike the usual kind you find in and around KL and maybe Malaysia. It is not starchy like the usual kind and not too watery too. Good enough to eat by itself without adding black vinegar.Taste overall is well balanced.The tea too is really good and lasting after refilling twice with hot water. Usual tea would have lost its taste and colour by then.It is like fine dining. However, the tea is really costly. This is something one have to bear in mind before ordering. Each cup would cost MYR16.90 before 10% service charge and 6% GST.Show less",4,Reviewed 29 October 2017 ,Putien

The last two times we dined here, we had to wait for quite a while for our food. Last week when we were there, a party of five of us, all of us had our meals and were done eating, but my husband had to wait for quite a long time for his bento set (sushi and udon). After complaining a few times, they brought the set over with the sushi but without the udon, and said he had to wait for the udon. When he was about to eat his sushi, he noticed a piece of hair on his food, lost his appetite, returned the bento set and refused to eat. The waitress was most apologetic about it, but it wasn't her fault, but the kitchen's. The manager came over and asked ""May I help you?"" which was a strange question because he should have apologised instead of asking such a question. The queue here at this restaurant is long.

We thought he copped out by picking the restaurant which is within his housing estate i.e. Tropicana.We were pleasantly surprised! The lamb rack we had was delicious and so was the thin crispy Jojo's pizza that we had. The Chairman had steak and he certainly enjoyed it.He then insisted that each of us must have an apple tart and I was very glad he did because it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was tangy, fluffy and the best apple tart I've had.The head waiter was on hand and available every time we raised our hands for something (perhaps he was already familiar with the Chairman), he certainly knew his menu by heart. He was attentive and helpful but never overcrowding. We had a table outside because the Chairman smokes and we were thoroughly lit up by the lights at the entrance to the Tropicana Club House.I have this habit of going over to check the toilets of the restaurants that I visit (just to be sure that the entire restaurant is clean and well kept) and I am happy to report that the ladies' was clean and smelt nice.Show less",4,Reviewed 5 November 2015 ,Jojo Italian Restaurant

The tomato bruchetta is no where close to what it used to be and the pizzas are smaller and less crisp. The mushroom bruschetta is definitely a miss, it is covered with melted cheese and you cannot taste the mushrooms at all. Ironically, the Canneloni, which was one of the best dishes, has been taken off the menu. Another thing I would point is to refrain from ordering the sirloin steak- it was badly seered, rubbery and bland. However, the pasta dishes are good on the whole. The desserts are also not bad overall, I much prefer how it used to be a while back. The tiramisu is either a hit or miss but when its a hit, it is really delicious. The Panna cotta too is mediocre.The restaurant interior actually has quite a nice feel and ambiance to it and the outside seating also makes a nice experience when the whether is good.Show less",3,Reviewed 3 November 2015 ,Jojo Italian Restaurant

The layout and everything was nice, but the seats were positioned too close together due to the limited space, resulting in a very cramped situation for dining. The quality of the food more than made up for it, though. For starters, they served us wild mushroom soup and tomato bruschetta. The bruschetta was only so-so, but the soup was lovely. For main course, I had the rack of lamb and it was delicious!! Very soft, tender, juicy lamb with a side of roasted potato and vegetables. Honestly, I had thought that the portions would be very small considering the type of restaurant this is, but I was surprised to find that the portions were quite good and managed to make me full! My friends who had the Organic Barramundi also had only great things to say about it.Ambience of the restaurant was romantic. Because we came on a Monday evening, there was no crowd except us.

"Pael GKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Appalling food,"If you are planning to dine at the social Subang empire, my advice is DONT BOTHER. We went this afternoon for mother's day lunch and I really wish we chose somewhere else. We ordered the green curry chicken, keow teow Chicken Diane and a mixed platter. The Green curry chicken was filled with bits of very stale and spoilt chicken. The curry itself was just oil floating on top of an overly used amount of cumin base. Someone needs to tell the chef that not everything green is a green curry. Needless to say, we didn't eat it. The chicken Diane came with two thin slices of hard and rubbery chicken with a sauce so salty that it was impossible to put in the mouth without having a salt burn. I tried to scrape away the sauce as much as I could and have the hard chicken. It was Mother's Day ans I didn't want my fourteen year old son to feel that I am not enjoying the day. The keow teow was supposed to be with tiger prawns and all that it had was three measly shrimps in it. It is evident that the food was cooked by either the steward or the commis Because no self respecting Chef will actually serve the dishes that was served today. I should know since we run hotels around the country and our executive chefs have taught me quite a bit over the years. The supervisors/ managers were all walking around, looking important, yet no one came to ask us how was the food. I guess they were already aware that they were serving spoilt and terrible tasting dishes, and thus didn't dare to ask. Even the waiters hardly understood English and trying to explain it to them without losing temper would have been impossible. This is my second visit to Social  The first one at the beginning of this year was so good that we wanted to spend this special day there. It's extremely disheartening to see how terrible theu have become in the past few months.Show less",1,Reviewed 12 May 2019 ,"The Social, Empire Subang"

"muppet911Bristol, United Kingdom",Lack of attention from staff lets this place down,"Went on a Sunday lunchtime for fathers day. First time at this outlet and wasn't expecting too much as this a 'generic' restaurant as far as I'm concerned. Food was surprisingly tasty, apart from chili fries - far far too salty. Only tried a selection of starters but all were good. The big thing that lets the place down is lack of attention from staff. We were led to a table and then abandoned and had to try too hard to get a waiter/waitress to attend. The waitress was also very very slow and didn't seem to know what was happening! In addition, I feel the beer is extremely overpriced - 50% more than say J&R Bottle and Boar in SS15, and that was Socials happy hour price. The wine (house wine) is acceptable at the happy hour price for a bottle (RM100). Although having said that I believe reading other reviews that prior to the GST elimination it was RM95! So if that is true then shame on Social for trying to con us. Overall I would say give it a try but like me, I'm sure you won't be in a hurry to rush back, which is a shame because that's why these places often end up closing after 12/15 months.Show less",3,Reviewed 17 June 2018 ,"The Social, Empire Subang"

So it's quite reasonable for the wait & taste. That's quite fast knowing that some restaurants takes about 45mins to prepare or nearly one to half a day to prep the dish to get the smoky fragrant smell.c) Pasta with scallops - at the menu description it states: Pasta Sauteed with large scallops, garlic, basil, olive oil, dried chilli & cream. I had the impression that it would come as something like a bolognaise styled pasta.. but when it was served, the pasta was flooded with the green coloured basil cream sauce =p. I would have enjoyed it more if the cream sauce is lesser.d) Rum & raisin ice cream for dessert - Can't really smell or taste the rum.. quite milky.All in all, waited about 45 - 50 mins for food to start being served to our table. Note: For mains / starters, try to order at the same time. if you want to add any order to your current order, it will be deemed as a new order, so kitchen will only make your new order later (therefore, you have to wait longer for your additional orders to arrive).

So naturally i chose Pelita and the one at Plaza Shah Alam has a decent crowd even during the MCO period. But this visit was rather disappointing: the curry was watery but the bigger flop was the fish roe. Cutting it caused a chunk to fly off the table, and i realised it was that hard because of re heating. One understands nasi kandar operators re heat their dishes but to get that hard must have been due to many re heating. If the Pelita owners are reading this, my plea is, please maintain quality as Penang nasi kandar rep is at stake. Pelita is a chain throughout Malaysia, why it even has a hotel in Penang, eponymously named The Light hotel. Surely the group is concerned about its reputation, and putting hard and elastic fish roe for customers to order is certainly not on.Will steer clear until my nasi kandaq instinct goads me again, against my better judgment.

It was a birthday celebration and one of my friends had done a lot of reading up about the Food Innovator Navin Karu, so we were quite excited to go there.Helas, the restaurant did not live up to its hyped up reputation.We ordered the calamari and the crab cake to start with. Calamari lacked seasoning, bland and soggy. The crab cake was nothing to shout about either.For mains, our order was 2 barramundi and one prawn pasta. Once again big disappointment, the dishes lacked flavour and seasoning. A major hiccup was that on the menu there was no mention of fresh cream being in the barramundi dish, but there was and since I am allergic to fresh cream the dish had to be sent back. I then ordered a lamb pizza which was ok. Long story short, i sat and watched while my other two guests ate their tasteless meal. The pizza arrived after everyone was done eating, except me. Not a very pleasant situation.All I can say is that this visit was sheer disappointment, more so for my friend who was really looking forward to sampling the food.

Emphasis on INSISTED as she was very RUDE and expected us to follow her even though we were already unhappy with the late service. When I asked to cancel, she then said to wait another 5 minutes to see if it was possible. UNBELIEVABLE! I don't believe there was even a manager on site on Christmas Eve to settle such matters.

It's rare to find a nice Italian place that serves actual Italian food. They don't have really traditional Italian dishes I believe. But the dishes they do serve have contemporary twists on traditional stuff like foccacia, pasta and pizza. I rate the food highly and the drink selection is also commendable. I should've had dessert but I was too full unfortunately. I did have a couple of complementary shots of limoncello right as I was leaving the restaurant. Which reminds me, the service was EXCELLENT. The waiters and waitresses were so nice. And I believe if you reciprocate that niceness then you'll definitely have an amazing time. 10/10 would return and try more amazing food from their menu.

RAMAN KUMAR - is the type of ""captain"" one should always have on a first visit! He made our evening extra special. Attentive. Charming. Making good suggestions on what to eat and drink. Kind enough to take into account the likes and dislikes of his guests. Quick to soothe ruffled feathers (esp mine) with a big smile and suaveness. We started off with cold BERRY BEER. It hit the thirsty throats in just the right spot.The food, we had a variety, was tasty, hot, fresh, served beautifully and service was fast.We tried an odd dish, fried by none other than Darshan himself. Spicy crab fried kway teow. One dish was not enough for us 8 to share.A must have is the mutton curry with toast named MADRAS SPICED LAMB. Tender melt in the mouth lamb and just spicy enough!I loved the BRANDY PRAWN BRUCHETTA. We had a pasta dish SPINACH MUSHROOM which was creamy but not heavy.

"leonintoSingapore, Singapore","Good food, stay away from the wine by the glass","Came here for dinner with the gf and enjoyed the service and food. My gf absolutely loved the spinach mushroom pasta because of the rich flavors of the sauce. The calamari was interesting but not quite what I expected. I'm used to a crispy batter instead of mushy and the chili sauce tasted weirdly like BBQ sauce. The pizza was good.But the house wines are horrible. The shiraz was drinkable, but not really enjoyable. The merlot was trash. Since I know it's not the kitchen staff making the wine, I will be honest about it. Even tho we're paying 26rmb + service/tax, we still left more than half the glass when we left because it was that bad. I've had this happen at other restaurants. Even tho alcholo is expensive due to government taxes, I still think the staff can pick something decent for guests to enjoy with their food.For example, Lavo has 2 cheap red wines (by bottle) for around 100rm that are very drinkable and nice. So, they're making 30 less on the bottle compared to the by the glass price at Vin's but it's easily 5x better.Please fix this.Anyways, stick to beer or wine by the bottle if you know what's good.Show less",4,Reviewed 2 February 2019 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

Anna S,Waited over 2 hours for my food - half of the order never arrived,"I booked on a Friday night, they said they didn't have a table for me but could seat me at the bar. OK. I ordered a bar snack, a main course and a side dish, and proceeded to wait for 2 hours for the food. After about an hour and a half I asked where it was, and was told that there was a problem with the kitchen and they didn't know when it was coming. The waiters then proceeded to ignore me as best they could. There was a woman next to me who walked in 1.5 hours after me and her food arrived straight away which was a bit irritating by that point as I was starving. I was on the verge of leaving when the bar snack finally arrived, however the side orders never materialised. I was so hungry I wolfed it down and then waited a while longer for my main course as it was 10pm and I didn't know where else I could get food at that point. When I asked for the bill I asked for something to be taken off it seeing as I had to wait so long. They didn't really want to and offered me free drinks (which I didn't want.) They reluctantly ended up taking the bar snack off the bill which was not very much considering I left there still hungry and annoyed from only having received half of my order and having wasted 2 hours of my Friday night waiting for half of my dinner.Show less",2,Reviewed 7 December 2018 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

When we arrived the place was already quite busy so there was a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, the service and food did not match. After about 5 minutes we were finally given the menus. It appears there's only one female wait staff whilst the male wait staff seem to only be serving drinks. She seemed responsible for taking orders for the entire restaurant, outside included! The entire night, we needed to flag someone down for service. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered bbq chicken. Sadly my salmon was overcooked and the skin was not that crispy. The bed of creamy spinach which it sat on was ok, however the dish was lacking another texture, something crispy or firm, everything was too soft and got a bit much after a while. The bbq chicken was incredibly bland, grilled chicken with a generic bbq sauce on the side and fries. We decided not to stay for dessert.

We ordered a burger and a pasta . Both came out together and we only had to wait for around 15 minutes which was good even though they were quite full. The food taste was very good and the cocktails very nice. There was some confusion during payment as we wanted to use the Entertainer however the manager was quick and nice enough to sort it out for us. All in all great place to dine.

So drove around the neighbourhod and found Vin's Restaurant & Bar. We decided to give Vin's a try. On entering we found the place more of a restaurant/pub than restaurant/bar.

Freshly squeezed juices are priced at RM12 per glass. Our meal for 3 persons comprising 3 pasta dishes and 3 glasses of freshly squeezed juices came to around RM180.

"karenj395Manchester, United Kingdom",Delicious food and lovely people and atmosphere.,"We ate at this restaurant tonight and had the tastiest food. We are staying in a hotel by the Petronas towers and went on a rainy evening and got stung by an expensive taxi journey there unfortunately. However we didn't let it ruin our dinner and the food would've cheered us up if we had. We shared the chicken nachos for a starter which we hoovered up as it was very yummy. Next my friend had the ribs which were "" the tenderest and tastiest I've ever had"" I had the cod which again no lie it was the best cod I've ever had and I love fish dishes and have eaten a lot of cod in my time. The accompanying pasta, asparagus and tomatoes were complimentary and also delicious. We drank a lovely Argentinian Malbec and ended on a lovely warm with a melting centre chocolate cake. Also delicious. The staff were lovely and helpful and organised a more affordable taxi journey home. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.Show less",5,Reviewed 4 September 2015 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

At the end when we were walking out, the guys called him back and told him that they had yet another error (again, it was staged) - that was when they brought two shots of either bailey's or kahlua's plus a cake for him, with a nicely-lit candle too. They were so warm, made us feel at home, and we had a good time laughing away when my hubby found out it was a prank. What a super experience - we have been telling everyone we know about this place.

"shobieeKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Oh No, we've discovered Vin's!","I stumbled upon Vin's by accident, after going through TA's list of best restaurants and decided to try the one closest to my home. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but oh Lord, the food is simply orgasmic. I've been there 5-6 times in the past 3 months, and each time, the food just keeps getting better. I'm a sucker for their carne de vinha, and their local dishes, which are extremely flavorful. I think, hands down, the best lamb ribs I've had in this part of town (and I've been to many restaurants within the city)!Service. Now this is what separates this special place from the rest. They remember your NAME, they remember what you like, they even remember the type of wine you ordered the last time! It feels like home now. Unfortunately for my expanding waistline, this place is too near home, so I reckon I'll be back many more times!!!My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here, he too, is a big fan of this place. You must try their lamb, which I absolutely love, it's juicy, full of flavor, the duck was simply awesome.. everything, really, everything I've tried, I've loved. Oh ok, but the desserts fall short, perhaps because the mains are too ""WOW"" we tend to criticize the desserts, but really, after such a full meal with wine accompaniment, who's got space left in their belly anyways?I'm so happy I discovered this place. If you haven't been there, you don't know what you're missing.

"LiveNLetLiveKuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia","Nice ambience, Great Food and Excellent Service","We recently visited Vin's during my niece's birthday. It is recommended to make reservations especially on Friday night or weekend as the place can get a bit crowded.There is an option to sit outdoors (limited area) or indoors. The ambience indoors is nice and soothing with the lights partially dim which is nice when one gradually sinks into the a relaxed mood heading into the weekend.Before moving on the food the service at this place deserves a special mention. The host showed us to our table and made sure we were comfortable. As it was our first time to the place she suggested a selection of beverages, starters and main course for us to sample. Even during our meal she came over just at the right time when she felt we wanted to order more items. It was a well balanced act which was not overwhelming that one would feel the privacy of one's dining is disturbed. Due to our dietary needs they were kind enough to change some of the topping on their pizza and even made a local noodle dish with a size of 1.5 portions. At one point we were even informed that one particular dish would take an extra 10mins as the chef was preparing it and there was a slight delay.For starters we sampled the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tikka Masala Tapas and Bruschetta. All the items were good and they have made each item their own in terms of taste and presentation.For the main course we had pizza which was customised to our toppings of choice. Next up we had pasta aglio olio which had just the right amount of spice and flavour. One surprising item which we took towards the end was the Penang Fried Noodles. This was recommended by the host and is truly an excellent dish.Finally for the dessert we tried the chocolate truflle cake. This was simply heavenly and it was warm and served with ice cream on the side.Overall it was an excellent evening and the service stands above many restaurants that are currently in the Klang valley.Show less",4,Reviewed 28 February 2013 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

They asked why did we arrived late and why did my partner placed his reservation at 10pm. So we chat and told them that my partner has just finished his job and that's why we were late. We also told them that we were hungry and asked for some groundnuts. Knowing how hungry we were, Lucky spoke to the chef as chef James himself came out to ask what we would like to have.They re-open their kitchen just for us! We ordered their special fried rice and they also served us with hot freshly fried nuts.However, my favourite dish wold be their grill chicken salad. The salad is fresh and the chicken is well seasoned.I considered Vin's to be the best neighbourhood bar. Navin the boss is so friendly and will always stop for a chat with all the patrons whenever he is around. Lucky and Raman are extraordinary waiters who will make your stay so enjoyable and memorable.We will continue to visit Vin's.Show less",5,Reviewed 4 February 2012 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

Capt_BolaKuala Lumpur,"Consistently Good Food, Great Atmosphere","Never mind that the word restaurant is misspelled here, but Vin's is a place that you will want to keep going to over and over. We have tried almost everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. Choose from their tapas selection of fried cod, bruschetta, chicken tikka, lamb masala, to name a few and it goes fantastic with a nice cold glass of Blackthorn cider. The skipjack tuna pizza and moghul masala pizza are superb. The lamb burger is the best we have ever tried. For local fare, you won't go wrong with mamak mee which puts all the mamak shops to shame. A great slection of wines, beers and spirits as well. Make sure you try this place if you are in KL. It's in Taman Tun and traffic can be bad from the city center on weekdays. Just google Vin's and you will get the directions and best to make reservations. Raman and Manish do a great job on the floor while the big kahuna Navin makes appearances a little late into the night.

"ShSuKLKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The best in Kuala Lumpur, by far.","Gary Portnoy and Judy Angelo wrote and performed a song called ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" as the theme song for the 1980s television hit-sitcom Cheers. The second time my wife and I went to Vin‚Äôs Restaurant and Bar, Taman Tun, Kuala Lumpur in September 2010, some 2 months after it opened, I was reminded of that song. Manish, who variously likes to be called Lucky, stopped us at the door and extended a warm welcome to me and my wife, and referred to us by our names. That was the moment I got completely hooked on the place. In Malaysia, where service standards are dubious at best, we stumbled upon a place where a service staff greeted us by our names on our second visit. I was overjoyed thinking I finally found a place; a brisk 12 minute walk from home; where I felt just like Norm, Cliff and Frasier did, all those years ago.Since that fateful evening in September 2010, we go to Vin‚Äôs at least twice a week. Truth be told, at times, its more times in a week than that. I am just fending off any thoughts you might have that we are raving alcoholic lunatics from the onset! To be frank, we go to Vins for 2 reasons. The first and most important reason is Navin, the head honcho of Vin‚Äôs, and his team of well trained and warm sidekicks. The second is to do with the fiendishly good food that Chefs Mano and James conjure up at the Vin‚Äôs. Now Navin and Chef Mano are the mainstays of the place. Navin infuses his nonchalant yet thoughtful brand of management to his entire team. He‚Äôs taught them to be warm and responsive to customers without being overbearing. There‚Äôs always someone available to help or to recommend; but no one ever overstays and they all know exactly when to bugger off! Just like Navin. Mano, the head chef really looks like a chef. Call me old fashioned, but I subscribe to the expression, ‚Äúnever trust a skinny cook‚Äù and going by that, you‚Äôd have nothing but confidence in Mano culinary skills. I understand that it‚Äôs a team effort to put food out, but Mano stands at the top of the heap when it comes to cooks who take their craft passionately and seriously. Somewhat diminutive yet with an ample girth, like the author of this piece, Mano puts out diabolically good food. The amiable Chef James, the other wizard in Vin‚Äôs kitchen, likewise matches the head chef in gastronomic prowess.These two, together with Navin, have created an array of wonderfully tantalizing dishes. Fusion tapas like the delectable Brandy Prawn Bruschetta; the locally sourced Spicy Lamb Sausages; and the fiery but ‚Äòun-put-down-able‚Äô Chicken Wings will take your taste buds to a different stratosphere.The wacky but completely magical concoctions like the Moghul Masala Pizza, with chicken tikka, feta cheese, onions and coriander, made a well travelled friend of ours from New Zealand, that great nation of rugby maniacs parked at the end of the world, to declare Vin‚Äôs pizza the ‚Äòbest in the world‚Äô.Main courses like the gorgeous Grilled Salmon on a ragout of creamy spinach; the insanely lip-smacking 3-Spiced Ribs; or the luscious Lamb Masala with lashing of simmering spices served with the flat home baked Focaccia will make your taste meter go mental.The beverage selection is outstanding. They have a superb selection beer, both bottled and on tap. And the bar staff are known to make a mean mojito. For the astute whisky drinker, Vin‚Äôs has a brilliant assortment, ranging from the ordinary to the sublime. Very few places in KL carry 17-year old Hibiki or Yamazaki from the Suntory stable in Japan or Indian Amrut Fusion Single Malt. Now don‚Äôt panic, you‚Äôll also get the usual the Glenfiddich, Macallan and the Auchentoshan. But Navin gets in some wonderful stuff like the 15 year old Bowmore Darkest and less known (in Malaysia) marks like Smokehead from Islay. Vin‚Äôs has great ambiance. The d√©cor is understated yet inviting. The music is always pleasant with an eclectic mix of jazz, fusion and soft pop. The clientele is discerning and non judgmental. The people who frequent the joint are local professionals and some interesting expats, usually with their partners. So, thank goodness it does not attract both the leery and the flaunty!The great unwashed tend to flock in on Fridays evenings, so booking may be necessary. Nothing wrong with this, I reckon! Everybody needs to experience Vin‚Äôs. Of course, the older and curmudgeonly patrons may not be welcoming the young‚Äôuns with open arms. But a good bar and restaurant needs them both in equal measure. The atmosphere on Friday evenings is more rambunctious than normal. Saturdays and Sunday evenings are equally raucous but with a more discerning clientele. The wife and I tend towards weekdays evenings. We do like to feel like part-owners of the place! All in all, if you want a place with excellent food, great ambiance and warm service, in a great neighborhood like Taman Tun in Kuala Lumpur, you‚Äòd be hard pressed to find anything better than Vin‚Äôs.Show less",5,Reviewed 16 October 2011 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

"ECKLKualaLumpurKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Less is More Part 349 - Tantalisingly Tasty Thrifty Treats,"A very charming, tastefully decorated and tidy little outpost in a sea of eateries in Dataran Sunway not far from The Strand. Quite understated on the outside and can be mistaken for a spa centre. Started by the chef owner who spent more than ten years in Bali and fell in love with the cuisine there. His sister manages the front counter. They serve most of the popular Balinese specialities except Babi Guling. But their beautifully chargrilled sate celeng (pork satay) makes up amply for that omission. We liked the sate lilit (minced fish satay) as well, fragrant with lemongrass. Babi kecap manis (stewed pork in dark sweet soya sauce) was particularly good, as was the Pesan be tuna (grilled tuna in banana leaf). Quite unique is the Spicy tuna soup which wasn‚Äôt really that hot. The 6 variations of the sharing platter (for four) are an excellent fun way to enjoy more variety. We loved the sambals too which are not too explosive. There were virtually no weak spots in the menu. If I had to grumble, I thought the vegetable dishes like the fried cabbage and long beans were too plain-tasting. Otherwise everything else was fine and the prices are more than reasonable.

We declined and left in disappointment.The serving was huge in single sets. I wasn't aware of this as I normally order sets for 4 people to share. Then I ordered some extra dishes yo share and it turned out to be too much food and we had to take away the leftover. I recommend sharing (ordering) a set first then decide if you want add-ons as it could be too much and they don't know how to warn you. The shocking part was my guests paid for then bill without our knowledge and it teally embarrassed me!

It's a Saturday night, parking was easy to find and its located in The Strand shophouses in Kota Damansara. The ambience was really nice. We were seated on the ground floor. Simple decor yet very welcoming and cozy. The balinese music on the background was soothing. It's fullhouse on the ground floor all by reservations when we arrived. We visited the first floor while waiting for our food. It's beautifully designed. The paddy field scenery with sit on the platform setting makes it such a cozy and relaxing place. My friend ordered 2 sets of the 4 person sharing platter. It has got 3 main dishes, and a variety of side dishes (more than 10). Ordering food here is simple and easy! The food came. We were all awed by the portion and presentation of the food. RM118 for a platter for 4 person! I remembered paying 70 odd bucks for platter just as appertizers in one of the other balinese restaurant around. The taste was marvellous. The crispy fried duck, bbq pork ribs, lemongrass flavoured grilled chicken, pork satay were very delicious. The pork sausage (which we were told homemade using fresh pork intestine) were a pleasant surprise. The sambals were great and delicious - sambal embo (not sure of the correct spelling, the one with fried onions and chilli) was really good with rice, and the sambal tomato was delicious too, though on a spicy side. We spoke to the young owner cum chef and was told that careful considerations were given in selecting the combination of the food in each of the basket to maximise flavour and texture variety. We all think that they did it perfectly well! Brilliant mind! I strongly recommended this place. To say it's the best Balinese restaurant is an understatement. It's actually one of the best restaurant around. Drinks: stick to the refreshing drinks on offer: lemongrass drink, fresh cucumber with lime and mint and markisa with lime and mint! They were all good! The portion were big, we were too full to try the dessert. Will be back for sure. Show less",5,Reviewed 30 November 2015 ,The Uma Bali

"laurelin88Cornwall, Canada","Pretty good food, nice find in KD. Staff not so great","For a restaurant with enough seats for up to 30 (based on the number of chairs they laid out), I expected the food to be amazing. When I saw that most of the very good reviews on Tripadvisor, I walked in. For starters, the staff didn't seem too eager to have me and my friend for dinner - we were the only two persons there on a Sunday evening. Two other persons dropped in after awhile. So with just 4 of us, I thought perhaps the staff would engage in some conversation to recommend us some signature dishes there. They didn't even bother, instead they were looking out at the street half dreaming. I ordered fried chicken with Balinese herbs with yellow rice and some veges as side dishes. My friend had her grilled pork ribs set. Sadly, her (overly cooked) set which was served together with mine was cool instead of hot. It's as though they left her set while mine was being prepared so both sets could be served together. My fried chicken was very nicely done and I especially enjoyed the refreshing lemongrass drink too. I would come back but I don't think this place deserves the #4 spot in PJ (based on whatever ratings sent in by reviewers). Price-wise, this place isn't too pricey.

ChristenChewSP,"Wow, impressive!","Was wondering how Non halal Indonesian taste like and stumbled upon the Uma from TA reviews. The 4 of us was suitably intrigued to explore and wow , were we pleasantly surprised. Ambiance was good, with ground floor more modern while first floor was more traditional. Suitable Balinese music soothed us and good AC with good service throughout the meal. The menu is not extensive, nasi ratus predominates with about 15 types of mains to choose from. This is rice with a few appetizers, cooked vege , sauces and lovely string fries we could not get enough of.There is a la carte options of appetizers, two soups, about 4-5 desserts and some choice of non alcoholic drinks. You can bring your own wine with no corkage which is of course what we did. Though bringing own glass might be a good idea too.Now on to the food, after some fifteen minutes and being the only ones there, the rice arrived with the platter and conversation stopped; only to be punctuated by, mmmm this is so good. everything tastes marvelous ! And not much msg judging from the after effects. My favorite was the pork ribs, sausage that reminds me so much of Chiangmai Sai o, the tuna with shallots. The fried duck was very good too but the others were better. The uma's satay asem and satay lilit was also good, juicy and tasteful without being excessively oily, unlike bumbu bali's.

First dish was served with pretty good decorations (although decorations was more for CNY) and tasted quite OK.7. Then there was quite a long time gap before the next dish. 8.

However, then we were served a sizzling brownie desert with cold and hard brownie, which we had to poke hard with the spoon to break it. That hard it was, and that too sizzling brownie.

Portion-wise was already a let-down and to add to that, the chicken meat was dry (parts given were the drumstick and thigh so for it to be dry is an 'achievement') and it felt extremely sub-par in quality.

Great first impression. As we entered this restaurant, we noticed that space was quite limited and tables were small and placed close together to sit maximum number of patrons. Don't expect a typical American diner with booths and soft cushioned benches.Items on the menu are quite limited. House salad was fresh though not spectacular. Soup of the day contained pieces of ham was pretty average. The baby back ribs was delicious, though the portion was about half of a typical American portion in the States. Probably this portion size suited most of their customers well as I noticed over 90% of them were locals when we were there.Mashed potatoes were fantastic, it came with a very delicious gravy. Pig in a blanket was a novelty, cocktail sausages wrapped in bacon was pretty average. For dessert we can apple crumble which was very good even though it was a tad too sweet. It was served with Vanilla ice-cream. Their chocolate ice-cream was good. We were told the ice-cream was imported from Iowa.Overall still a pleasant and enjoyable meal, even though we would prefer booths with solid tables and American portions of food.

Their food quality has not changed, the food is good but when my apple crumble dish was served, I was really disappointed. They maintain the usual 2 ice-cream scoops on top of the apple crumble, however I can see that they have tremendously reduced the amount of apple slices. Basically, I was eating the ice cream and the sweet filling (that was cooked together with the apple slices) more than anything else. When I have just completed my meal, 5 minutes later this uncle (whom I presume is the owner/owner's family) came and asked us if we need any additional orders with a smile. So we replied, ""No and thanks for asking"". He continued to smile and replied ""Alright, we have a long line waiting outside. Do put your thoughts into it"", smiled and walked away.

The restaurant is owned by a Korean husband & wife team.As with a typical Korean BBQ restaurant, the ambience and decor are as expected (don't expect high class). A large area is dedicated to sitting on the short wooden tables without shoes but not to worry - the floor below the table lets you sit properly, not cross-legged. We ordered the pork neck and lamb BBQ plus a Bulgogi set. The service we feel is a little slow as we had to ask a few times about our side dishes and drinks. The bulgogi came first and the taste and authenticity of it are really good. Side dishes were also nice although the kimchi portions were a little big and preferred if the portions were smaller. Do not expect side dishes to be refilled, except for lettuce and sauces. The pork neck and lamb were very tender and just nicely marinated. It really tastes like how one would eat it in Korea.

Faridah attended to us and from the first greeting, we knew we would get along great. Her level of service was intuitive and genuine, a gold standard that hospitality books need to highlight.

We didn't really mind but with such a big space, they could put more tables rather than just 12. The ambience is not bad. The menu was simple and unfortunately the food we wanted to order was not available anymore (even though it was only 7ish in the evening). If the waitress inform us when she sit us down rather than telling us when we were ready to order would gain some brownie points from us. We had the fresh scallops with salted egg yolk puree and shaved parmesan. Scallops were cooked perfectly however the whole salted egg yolk and parmesan thing was alright. With everyone trying to come up with a dish using salted egg yolk nowadays makes it less special. Honestly, in my opinion, I find this appetiser weird. It doesn't seem to blend well. I had the duck confit for my entree. Portion was rather small for the price that I was paying and it was very salty for my liking that I had to keep eating it with the mashed. I had to drink loads of water to wash down the saltiness the rest of the evening which was not so pleasant. The mashed potato was alright, wish that it was more smooth.

Jacqueline FKuala Lumpur,Great food and value for money!! Love it!!,"WhupWhup is a really unique place - a restaurant run by a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef inside an old factory, which has been cleaned out and decked out to serve hearty soul food and expertly crafted coffee.Chef Liang and the young team that runs the place made sure they kept as much of the factory's character in the restaurant, which makes for a lot of quirky, Instagram-worthy touches. Some of the machines were artfully turned into tables and coffee bars, a huge ""Safety First"" sign remains on the mezzanine, and there's a huge industrial-size steel water tank hanging at the back.The space itself is absolutely huge, which makes it perfect for big parties and private functions -- especially if you want the post-event photos to look really interesting and unique.NOW TO THE FOOD AND DRINK. The head barista used to be a trainer with Barista Guild Asia, so he knows his stuff. I'm not the most discerning coffee drinker, so all I can say is that it tasted good. I liked it. We had good times. #AcidityWhatAcidity?As for the food, I've tried the glazed lamb shank with ratatouille and roasted potatoes a couple of times, and it was AMAZING each time. You could put that glaze on a car tire and it would still taste good. The itself lamb falls of the bone, and the whole dish is just so hearty and filling.I've also had the Duck Three Ways, which seems to be a favourite. It comes with succulent duck breast on a bed of pasta cooked with SALTED DUCK EGG YOLK and DUCK BACON (talk about a triple threat!). Personally, I like my salted egg yolk to be smooth and runny, but the treatment on this one's a bit different - it has more texture to it. Still, it's a very decadent dish, one of those that will put a smile on your face when you're done.In terms of dessert, I will definitely recommend The Babyface -- a chocolate tart that's really rich and smooth. You gotta try it. The serving's a little small for me, but then again, I'd take a mountain of that goodness and it still wouldn't be enough.Price-wise, it's very reasonable considering the portions and quality. The lamb shank - one of the most expensive items on the menu - is around RM35 (if I remember correctly), Duck Three Ways is RM20-something (RM25??), and The Babyface is RM10. Coffee prices are pretty much standard Klang Valley prices la.It's a great place to go with friends and family, because Chef Liang and his team have created a really warm, friendly environment. Pair that with good food and coffee, and you've got a recipe for good times all around.Show less",5,Reviewed 29 January 2016 ,WhupWhup

"toozgxSubang Jaya, Malaysia",Spaghetti buffet? Why not.,"Having read an online article at the end of 2015 listing a number of the best restaurants in the Klang Valley are, Secret of Louisiana bagged the category for best budget buffet. Much to my surprise, spaghetti was the main item, at a very attractive RM19.90++ for all-you-can-eat.Soon enough me and my friends made plans and now I write this review after having just tried it (February 2016), I can say that the verdict is good.They offer a selection of 13 different pastas. Along with that, they served free-flow ice lemon tea, soup of the day, garden salad, garlic bread as well as 1 ice-cream per pax.The pastas were small portioned. But since it's an all-you-can-eat, the small portions were preferable, as we get to try the variety of flavours they offered. As for taste, they were reasonably well flavoured, definitely far from disappointing. My favourites were the Mexican Aglio Olio and the Beef Bolognaise, all which were done rather well.The decor of the place was a plus point. Delightfully homey while not being too tacky, the atmosphere does feel like what a typical Louisiana diner would be like. Service was mostly pleasant, the servers were responsive and friendly despite the huge crowd that was there.The few things that might irk people are that some of the pastas were warm, not pipping hot. I don't mind it as much because I suppose this is the best they can do granted it is an all-you-can-eat. Also towards the later part of lunch service, food came a little slower, as I can observe the staff being a little short-handed due to the crowd.In conclusion, if you have a huge appetite and a love for pastas, by all means try this place. For such a price, I'd be hard-pressed to look for complains. Just take note that service is better during the early part of lunch service (we were there from 12pm).*This review is for the Spaghetti Buffet part of the restaurant menu. They also have an ala carte menu which I've yet to try, but am curious to some time in the future. For that I might write a separate review.Show less",4,Reviewed 4 February 2016 ,Secret of Louisiana
"JonathanLienKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sure sounds like a great idea!,"I work with people from Louisiana, and I've been on a work trip there. Absolutely love the place, the people, the shopping (this is great countrywide) and especially the food! So when I got back here I've been raving about crawfish and etouffee and craving for such foods all the time! When I found out about this place, I was ecstatic and rounded up the family and headed there almost immediately. The location is awesome. A lot of parking, easy access, you eat facing a lake (not a great lake, just A lake) and the waiters were very very nice. Great crew there. Prior to getting there I had visited the restaurant's website and discussed the wonderful spread with my boss (from Louisiana) and he knows all the dishes, which makes this very authentic. There were no prices listed online (that I could see), which is somewhat to be expected. When we got there I had ordered up a feast for 3 adults and a toddler. We had certainly over ordered but I was just too excited to try everything! The crawfish was very very expensive, but I just had to try them. If it's your first time eating such food then you will certainly walk away very satisfied and happy. However, this was not the case for me. The menu looked and sounded authentic but not the taste. The crawfish wasn't as fresh as I would have expected, seeing they had some live ones on display. Not sure if we're served live ones or frozen ones. The etouffee was nice on its own but not exactly how I remembered it to taste like. If you've been to Louisiana and hoping to replicate the taste here, be prepared to be disappointed. If you're having this for the first time, you would likely enjoy the meal. Bottom line, the price does not justify the portions as although it's a large portion served, the actual 'good stuff' that you're after is very little. There's heaps more other stuff and garnishing thrown in instead to make the portion seem large - get what I mean?Show less",3,Reviewed 15 December 2015 ,Secret of Louisiana
Joyce L,Not impressed,"We went for the spaghetti buffet but our overall experience didn't live up to its hype. The environment was okay - the chairs and tables outdoor was low quality and really flimsy and they serve with plastic plates and bowls. The spaghetti itself were alright, portions were small but I suppose it fits the purpose of a buffet. The Mexican Aglio Olio was delicious, however there are little to non-existing protein in the other spaghetti dishes (ie there are only 3 small pieces of fish in my fish pesto spaghetti and also the chicken carbonara). Drinks were horrible. The ice lemon tea we ordered was tasteless and bitter! Mushroom soup was alright but garlic bread was disappointing. The ""garlic bread"" were bite-size sliced baguettes baked with margarine and had no garlic whatsoever. The ice-cream served at the end had a strange and unpleasant taste. With our experience going downhill from the start we've pretty much given up on our food by the end of it. The only positive comment I can give was the decent service and the Mexican Aglio Olio. The price for the buffet itself wasn't expensive - however they are only screaming the obvious by serving low quality food to the customers.Show less",2,Reviewed 8 August 2015 ,Secret of Louisiana

Most of what we had were really good. However, the standard wasn't as good during the event - some of the food were not as tasteful (probably because they were prepared in big batches), plus the food was not being kept warm enough. All in all, I would say the standard was just average. They are however well known for their lunch promo, which is another reason why our food took a long time to arrive during the tasting. The place was packed and apparently, they cook the spaghetti in fresh batches (not pre-cooked, buffet style).

Pricing is a little on the high side although it is to be expected of banana leaf restaurants. Show less",4,Reviewed 16 July 2016 ,Krishna Curry House
"snowy1_66Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Banana Leaf Lovers,"If you are a Banana Leaf Lover, then you should not miss this place. I have been to this restaurant a couple of time. One thing I love about this restaurant is they are generous in their vegetable portion. Food is really good. I love their chicken curry, mutton, sambar, crab rasam, chicken varuval, fry fish and etc. This restaurant is located in Petaling Jaya and it's has parking space. But you need to be there a bit early to find space for parking as lunch time is crowded. In term of pricing, they are reasonable and i would say, value for money. So check this place out.

"Kiret100808Shah Alam, Malaysia",Pathetic Service... Lack of Manners,"Food was okay...i try many different food outlets all around Klang Valley and i was terribly disappointed with my visit here...I was not given proper information on the pricing of the food as i took one set of banana leaf briyani, but i had two others with me who were just gonna share that meal with me... They had banana leaves served for them as well and all was fine... once i was done, for a serving of briyani (rm7 actual price) and claypot curry (rm10), fresh milk and lassi, i paid nearly rm35.... i was surprised and when i questioned the cashier to show me the receipt... he stared me down while vigorously pulling out the receipt from the printer and lightly smacked it on my palms... i became furious with such an attitude, because that is not how you treat your customers... people come here to pay for what they eat, and when they are charged, they are entitled to know exactly what was billed for them, which is what i did....i saw some other food items registered in the my receipt but he refused to give the money back as he said i ordered those items and havent paid for it.Despite the food being alright, what ticks me off is bad service and unfriendly workers. It is my last time going back there, and i would recommend better places for briyani.. My favourite thus far : Nirvana Maju at Bangsar and Klang Bawah Jamabatan, Jalan Pengkalan (Wed and Fri for briyani)..Cheers !Show less",1,Reviewed 22 September 2014 ,Krishna Curry House

"gracelimshHorley, United Kingdom",Fantastic food!,"We were back from abroad, visiting family in Subang and they recommended this place which they said served Thai street food which was different to the usual Thai fare. I was sceptical at first but I was soon proved wrong.The restaurant itself is quite small and it does get busy, so it‚Äôs a good idea to get there early. It‚Äôs a no frills restaurant, so don‚Äôt expect anything fancy.We had the green curry, pork skewers, papaya salad, quail‚Äôs eggs, chicken wings and tom yam soup. All the dishes were excellent, especially the green curry which was thick and delicious. The pork skewers were also very good, tender and very tasty. My son had the durian cheesecake for dessert and that was absolutely divine!We enjoyed it so much that we went back two days later! They do set meals for lunch which are very good value. We will definitely be back next year!Show less",5,Reviewed 15 April 2019 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food
"LobsterlyySubang Jaya, Malaysia",Servers missed our order,"My bf and I were already very hungry when we came in, and managed to get last order (9pm). However, they forgot to key in one of our mains and when we complained, they merely apologised meekly and said nothing can be done. I understand that human mistakes can happen, but now we will have to set off to find another place to satisfy our hunger pangs. Maybe the place should‚Äôve offered some free snacks/drink as a compensation? The best they did was to recommend us to order dessert, but who would even eat dessert before their mains ??Was not satisfied .Show less",1,Reviewed 14 December 2018 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Okay,This is essentially a pork based eatery - almost identical to what you would find in a typical Bangkok shop. There was only 1 single chicken based dish throughout the menu - a green curry. This was ok although I could tell that it had the potential to be better if they would just up the ante on the spice. I liked the tako but the Red Ruby was disappointing-coarse iceShow less,3,Reviewed 18 January 2018 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food
