HensemNaan,Honestly not good,"Honestly not good. The lamb haneeth was obviously tender since anyone can cook it tender when u simmer it for that long. However it cannot go anymore blander than what my tastebuds felt that way. The rice was in big portion but obviously any arab place would serve equally large portions. There is no discernible difference between mandy, kabsa or other rice forms, so why bother?The shawarma was basically air wrapped pita. Very stingy with portions somehow, mayonnaiss tastes like unsweetened milk curd.It is somehow still packed with Shah Alam's most desensate-tongued patrons who continuously pleasure themselves with the illusion of good food.0/10 dont ever come hereShow less",1,Reviewed 27 November 2021 ,Mozer's

The meat portion sizes for the lamb and chicken shawarma 'platters' were much smaller then expected. In other countries a platter is a platter, here the platter was much less than a plate.

Lebanese Bread, Chicken Shwarma, Sheesh kebab, Foul, Hummus w lamb (my personal favourite), Healthy salads (that I find delightful) , falafel, several pasta dish (non mid eastern choice) and the best part, more & more dishes are added like monthly. Did I miss out rice? Well they do have rice of course. A variety of them Mendy Rice, kabsah rice, Iranian rice and makhlouba rice (sorry x sure of exact spelling). Its just that, For me their best product is non rice. At first we thought they are only open at night, what a pleasant surprise when I aproached the lady owner and she informed that they do lunch as well. Food price range from RM6 for a plate of Falafel or for a bowl of Hummus with a basket of bread, to RM20 for Grilled fish (delish!). Drinks? Mint tea of course- fresh mint in the pot just for RM4- a good deal for me & hubby. Yup they hv fruit juice : get the freshly blended one ! My mango juice or was yummy. Do give it a try if you happen to be in the neighbourhood. Am looking forward for Philly & Lamb Shwarma to be added to the menu. ^__^Show less",4,Reviewed 28 December 2012 ,Mozer's

"copycalebKlang, Malaysia",My personal favorite,"I have to highlight the title for this review. 'Personal' here means 'subjective' because bak kut teh is one of the most subjective dishes around. It's not like chicken rice where almost everyone can agree if it's good or bad. When it comes to bak kut teh, the range of preferences for the soup base to the cut of meat is immense. So, for me, I like my soup to be dense and richly flavored, and my meat to have both lean and fat parts, and I like all the other stuff that comes with the claypot - mushrooms, beancurd, etc. So, if this is your type of bak kut teh, then this is the spot.

Bak Kut Teh (from RM9) here comes in two forms: the soupy herbal claypot-style and a dark, aromatic dry version. The restaurant's reputation beckons that you try both, tasty in equal measure. The broth strays from Klang's usual concentrated kind for a light but flavourful one, which seeps well into the sides of puffy tofu pok, fu chuk and the must-have Yau Char Kwai (RM2).

The serving staff showed us a box with a few varieties of Chinese tea bags to choose. After choosing our favourite brand of Chinese, within minutes each of us was given two small tea cups and a pot of very hot tea for all. Another waiter came to take our BKT order. We had a standard dry Bak Kut Teh (BKT) in a clay pot for two persons without additional ingredients. It is pork braised until very soft in dark soya sauce with a little of salted fish. We then ordered the usual soupy BKT. We had to specify what other ingredients and particular types of pork to add to the herbal soup or broth. We ordered a clay pot of BKT for two persons with half lean, half fat pork, pig's stomach and tendons and pork ribs as well as shiitake that were added to the standard BKT soup/broth. We also had a small bowl of Yau Cha Kwai which went well with BKT and an ordinary plate of plainly fried Cos lettuce. We left the restaurant happy with the service, the fairly well cooked BKT that had a mild flavour of herbs and the generous topping up of the BKT herbal soup/broth.

"WilliamTan168Klang, Malaysia",Awful Service & Cocky Waitress,"To be fair, there were obviously some commendable points about this restaurant - free and ample car park both within and opposite the building; quite a nice ambience (even though no air-con) with decent interior adornments; and a visit to the washroom was quite an eye-opening experience for the first-comers like us. The initial impression was good, and the crabs together with other dishes that we ordered were generally quite tasty.Unfortunately, all these good qualities were easily overshadowed by the shoddy and arrogant service rendered by the restaurant.We brought some elderly guests and when they served us the peanuts as tidbits, we returned the same as they were too hard for the teeth of our guests. To our dismay, the waitress (ostensibly the captain of the service personnel) immediately pulled a long face and took away the tidbits in a very hard and unpleasant manner with words grumbling from her mouth, as if we owed her something.Subsequently came to the ordering of the dishes, as our guests were only conversant in Mandarin, we naturally spoke and communicated with the (same, yes) waitress in Mandarin. However, she insisted on conversing with us in Cantonese, whether deliberately or otherwise, and refused to explain further to our guests (in Mandarin) the cooking style of the dishes, and took our order in a harsh and hasty manner, leaving us with bewilderness and embarrassment in front of our guests.For the upmarket prices that we paid for the food there, we were only given a night market service. We also could not believe that in an era when even the Hong Kong people can speak better Mandarin than the Mainlanders, this 5 star restaurant had hired someone who could barely speak 1 star Mandarin. One is of course entitled to speak whichever vernacular he/she prefers in his/her own house, but this is not so (and cannot be so) when it comes to service industry.Lastly, the prices are definitely not commensurate with the qualities and types of the dishes offered there and the level of the restaurant. If you are willing to pay such a price for that kind of dishes, then there are so many other high class restaurants out there to choose from, where you would be treated like an emperor instead of being hurled with abusive words when you simply reject their tidbits.Show less",1,Reviewed 4 May 2016 ,South Sea Seafood

They do have a menu but the best way to order is to go up and chose your seafood and ask the service staff for the best way/most popular way to cook each type. Rarely are you disappointed with the recommendation. I had never had geoduck before and left it in the hands of the chefs to cook however they wanted. It was absolutely delicious. Something is to be said for a restaurant where you can just leave it in the hands of the chefs.Top dishes for me are: curry crab (sri lankan crab); nestum prawns (I ask them to de-shell it for me as I am lazy); lala with spring onions and ginger; razor clams and steamed fish. The veg is also cooked very well too. Also, be sure to order a coconut or two!As it's very popular I recommend booking ahead of time, especially for a weekend dinner.

Personally I don't like the Sweet & Sour Crabs, I recommend the 'kam heong' crabs. The service is excellent and well above expectations for a Chinese restaurant. Each waiter has his/her service station, and there were at least 2 waiters who were servicing our table (of only 5 pax). Eventhough the restaurant was packed to the brim, they pro-actively refilled our tea and changed our plates. Can't say the same for senior management though, they can come across as arrogant. There are parking service attendants with umbrellas to assist you on a rainy day, and parking is free too for dine-in customers unlike the other Chinese restaurants in KL. Advance reservations is recommendation especially for large group to avoid disappointment. The place gets really packed esp on weekends.Show less",4,Reviewed 24 February 2013 ,South Sea Seafood

I had the nasi campur so as to be able to try a wider range of food. The food served was too sweet and the minced meat on lemongrass was with so much filler that i do not know what it was meant to be.

We had to wait about 15min for our food but considering the crowd, it was quite quick. Furthermore we enjoyed watching the crew prepare the food like in a synchronised performance. We ordered the Nasi Campur, which is a mixed platter with rice and condiments; and it is served with tender grilled chicken, 2 prawns, squid, fish and minced meat on a lemongrass skewer. The condiments for the rice was dabomb! I could just finish the rice with the condiments alone! Another dish we ordered was the Sup Buntut. An Indonesian styled oxtail soup that came with rice cakes and a piece of garlic bread on the side. The soup was too oily so we skimmed away the layer of oil before digging in. The soup lacks a certain punch without the usual peppery taste that is expected from any decent Sup buntut. Their Drinks list were extensive but it is a halal restaurant so they only serve mocktails. We ordered a cucumber mohito and a lime and honey papaya ice blend. We felt that the drinks were too sweet so perhaps you can specify ""less sugar"" when placing your orders.

Now it is an Italian Restaurant. The restaurant is still the same, with great ambience and the nightly band adds a touch of romance with their beautiful songs. The staff was attentive and polite but the food was such a disappointment. We started with a sweet cherry tomato soup with fresh basil pesto and buffalo mozzarella (RM 43). It tasted as if coming out of a can, not fresh, no pesto and small bits of cheese. My husband had oven baked layer of eggplant parmigiana style with roma tomatoes and parmesan fondue (RM 37). This dish was very dry and did not taste like freshly made but rather as it just had been defrosted for convenience and no tomato taste at all.Then for our second course I ordered homemade durum saffron Maltagliati with cannellini bean puree and scallop (RM 58). That was one of the worst pasta I have ever tasted. All the pasta stuck together and it was laid in a starchy sauce with bits and pieces of uncooked scallops and completely tasteless. My husband ordered the pan roasted black Cod with mixed bell pepper and calamari (RM 112). The cod was definitely fresh and juicy but that's all. The calamari were all extremely chewy like rubber and were too hard to eat. Usually Italian chefs know how to cook them tender. Moreover the sauce was completely tasteless.One note of welcome surprise was the staff came with a crème brûlée at the end of our meal to celebrate my husband's birthday and the band was kind to sing a birthday song for him. That was very touching.Since the Chef was nowhere in sight that night it is fair to say that his staff are completely useless and he is not a very good teacher. The waiting staff apologised for the entire meal flop and the supervisor told us the chef would visit us the following day and have a chat with us but alas he did not show up nor searched for us.

Roam174246,Wedding Event,"A BIG THANK YOU shout out to Jeffrey, the Manager and his team for an excellent wedding dinner reception. In my PR profession, I have organised many events and last nite was one of my rare wedding event to organise for a cousin. We kept the programme simple so that everyone could focus on the good food and I must say ......dinner went tremendously well thanks the chefs at Ti Chen. Everyone gave praise to the food especially the restaurant's special smoked duck, double boil soup and braised abalone. The mango dessert was just simply delicious. It was a five star meal and to say that in front of senior aunties and uncles who are food connoisseur equivalent is really something. Service was just fantastic. From the very start of organising this event, both Geetha from Saujana banquet and Jeffrey gave us their utmost attention and made accommodation to our requests. Parents of the groom who hosted the dinner was absolutely delighted with their choice to hold the wedding at Ti Chen. Another plus point is that Ti Chen sits beautifully by the lake and lightens up the mood and atmosphere for everyone who attended the wedding. My personal recommendation......go try the dim sum and if lucky you may even get to order their special award winning white and green bitter gourd dessert.Show less",5,Reviewed 31 March 2019 ,Ti Chen Chinese Restaurant
"ArthyTravellerArth, Switzerland",Gault Millau excellence,"When it comes to service excellence...we think the entire Ti Chen team knows best! We had a great start from the attentive service from the manager, Mr. Jeffrey. From the point of reservation, menu design up to the actual event. His team was simply outstanding.Being personally attended by Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan) and they empathetically designed a menu which suited to the psychographic profiles of our guest. This is a definite differentiator compared to others.Also, chinese cuisine esp dim sum normally inclines to using pork as the base ingredient. Chef Yeow expertise is creating the texture from chicken meat as closely resembling pork texture and taste even better. That's an art!Then we have guests who do not take beef nor lamb, but Chef (Lim & Chan) impressed us with the chicken soup in black garlic, the unique lo hon chai and the outstanding sweet & sour fish. The service was simply outstanding. Our guests were totally impressed with not only the well thought through menu but the teamwork from the chefs up to the serving team. Our appreciation to Mr. Jeffrey, Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan) and the entire Ti Chen team. Gault-Millau should consider the ""nouvelle cuisine"" presented by Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan). For Chef (Yeow, Lim & Chan) we hope you continue to innovate and delight the palates of connoisseur & those who appreciates.

Had a company dinner with 5 tables occupying the restaurant.We had the 10 pax cny dinner @ RM 2288 nett-Salmon and snow pear yee sang with black currant plum dressing. Salmon are not fresh and lucky is the very thinly slice. Smells fishy- Braised crab meat soup with assorted seafood and bamboo pith. This soup are the best dishes of this whole course. - Baked chicken in coconut milk and lemongrass served with crispy mantou. Chicken are tender even though it’s baked. The sauce are thick and yummy as it’s like sweet curry taste - Crispy prawn coated with lemon dressing garnished with tropical fruit salsa and tobikko. This dish just normal and it would be better if they use fresh fruits instead of canned fruits. Could use more sauce to coat the while crispy prawns.- Hongkong style steamed dragon grouper in superior sauce are nice but wasted as OVERCOOK. The yummy fish meat are hard what a waste. - Braised abalone 10head, sun dried mushrooms and fattchoy with broccoli are nice but it would be better to have more fattchoy on top. Sauce are nice and not salty.- Mini steamed glutinous rice with oyster and chicken wrapped in lotus leaf. The glutinous are yummy too as flavorful but not salty. -Chilled pumpkin purée with sago and ice cream and crispy deep fried Chinese brown sugar balls are okay. Nothing special or wow.

We initially went to Saujana to look at other restaurants and venues for the dinner, but we chanced upon the Charcoal Grill Restaurant right before we left and immediately fell in love with the cosy and casual (but classy) setting of the restaurant. We met with the restaurant manager, Mr Mahesan, who was incredibly organised and helpful from the minute we met him. We only met him twice before the wedding - the first time on the day we went to visit Saujana and the second time a week before the dinner and him and his team pulled off the organisation of the wedding perfectly! The venue accommodates 150 people indoors comfortably and the dinner service (buffet) was priced very reasonably and included dishes like fresh prawns and oysters, sashimi, a variety of local dishes (including a full dessert spread). The service was impeccable and everyone was always within reach of a member of staff who provided service with a smile (no matter how late it got). Although there was a bit of a line when the guests went to get their food for the first time, the staff managed to organise the guests and get the line moving efficiently throughout the night. Everyone was so busy talking to each other in the line, the wait was completely bearable.Everything from the stage and backdrop to the mic and speakers were provided by the restaurant. I had my wedding playlist downloaded on my phone and planned to plug it in to the sound system that night but completely forgot about the iPhone audio jack adapter and was panicking about it 30 mins before the start of the dinner, but within 5 minutes of letting Mahesan know about this, he managed to borrow one off his colleague for the rest of the night just for us!We received so many compliments from the guests about the food and venue (my husband and I were so pleased about this because the buffet dinner concept was very different to the conventional sit-down Chinese wedding dinner), but everything went so smoothly. My husband and I did not have to worry about a single thing during the entire dinner and it was all thanks to the amazing service provided by Mahesan and his team at Charcoal Restaurant, Saujana Hotel.100% would recommend to anyone who wants a low fuss yet super classy wedding dinner in Malaysia!

"Benrey9Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",“Good Pork Ribs But Service Attitude Of Staff Can Be Improved !”,"It is so unfortunate that the service even though it is prompt despite the packed lunch time noisy crowd is marred at times by the robotic unfriendly attitude of some staff and boss . This is rare but is common in some popular restaurants where I reckon the business is so good with more than enough customers to keep the tables full and the profits rolling in . The demand overrides the supply so to say . Many customers are willing to compromise if the taste of food can compensate this attitude of staff and some of them learn to accept it or accept it whenever they frequent this restaurant . As the Malaysian saying goes "" If you see the restaurant packed with people than the food must be good"". Good or not, this is so true about this restaurant .The restaurant used to be located near the Klang river on the Bukit Kuda stretch in front of Sri Intan Cinema before they shifted here . They have built up their large customer market for their renowned pork dishes especially for the ribs and chops during the 30 over years they have been in business . They used to serve very delicious pork dishes there but they are not as good today . However they still have a large customer base patronising their restaurant . They also have other complimentary Chinese food on their menu but as the name of the restaurant suggest, it is for "" Hakka paikut "" translated meaning ""Hakka pork ribs"" that attract many customers mainly of Chinese origin to dine at this restaurant .Show less",3,Reviewed 10 October 2014 ,Peng Heong Hakka Paikut Restaurant

DicksonO29,My number 1 Bak Kut Teh Place,"This restaurant have been around for a very long time. They used to be located in one of the shop lots opposite their current shop now but since a year or two ago, they have moved to this new location.I've been eating at this restaurant ever since I was still a kid and it has been maybe more than 15 years. This is the only place I go for Bak Kut Teh whenever I visit Klang or there are times where I will just drive all the way to Klang for this bak kut teh. (I stay in Sri Gombak, Batu Caves)What I order here is always the ""Sai Chi Kuat"" which translates to ""Small Bone"". If you ask those locals in Klang, thats what you should always order for Bak kut teh or you can also order ""Dai Chi Kuat"" (Big Bone). Most people from KL will always go for pork belly which I don't recommend at all because the pork belly part doesn't really absorb the rich taste of the soup. Also, you can have sea cucumber added to your bak kut teh. Here's a list of things you can add to your bak kut teh here or order a separate pot for it:1. Sea Cucumber - Add on 2. Beancurd Skin (Foo Chuk) - Add on/Separate Pot3. Enokitake (Needle Mushroom) - Add on / Separate Pot4. Pork Innards - Not sure (Since I don't eat innards)5. Yau Char Guai - Separate (Must Have for bak kut teh)Warning!!NEVER go for the dry bak kut teh here. The dry bak kut teh here is not nice at all. Only go for their soup bak kut teh. If you want to have dry bak kut teh, you can find better ones in Kepong. If you want to takeaway, always remember to ask for more soup to be packed or you will get very little amount of soup which will definitely not be enough. This has happened to me a few times and now we always ask them to pack more (though they will try to not give u a lot so you have to be quite persistent)Tips: If you are already eating here and wants to take away for dinner or the next meal, leave some pork/vegetables/foo chuck in your current pot of bak kut teh, ask them to refill the pot with soup and pack this so you get more soup for your takeaway. The price for one portion of bak kut teh (normal with no add ons for ""Sai Chi Kuat"") is RM 12 excluding rice, yau char guai. Usually I spend about RM 20 per person here with all the add ons.Show less",5,Reviewed 7 November 2018 ,Restoran Weng Heong

"sling44Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Friendly service, decent coffee, early breakfast","Whenever I'm at Atria I stop by here to get a decent cup of piccolo latte. And usually I end up staying a while longer than planned, reading a book or getting some work done. The food items (written on the wall) that I've tried so far were all tasty and freshly prepared. Not huge portions, but I tend to be more impressed by quality than quantity anyway. I especially like the lamb kebabs, the fruit salad with mint, and the muesli.What sets Antipodean apart - besides the fact that it's open-plan, smack in the middle of the mall, which may not be to everyone's liking - however, are two things: First, that it's one of the few places around that offer a western-style breakfast from 8:30am onwards. Most other cafés are still fast asleep at that time of day. And, second, its friendly and efficient staff. On one of my visits they mistakenly overcharged me, without my noticing it. And would you know it? On my next visit they came to me with my bill from before, explained what had happened, and refunded the overcharged amount.Show less",5,Reviewed 5 June 2017 ,Antipodean Atria

When I reached out to take the dish from her, she thanked me. From my observation, she was friendly towards her staff. How encouraging!

The decor has remained unchanged and offers a more rustic feel for diners comared to the newer outlets. Seating capacity is limited on the ground floor as it is shared with the kitchen & bar counter but more are available on the 1st floor.Another thing that has remained unchanged over the years is the food quality which is just as good as when it first opened its door for business. Literally everything ordered off the menu is good & tasty. The bento sets is always a popular choice and for those with a knack for something different, try the Uni (sea urchin). Admittedly it is quite pricey but the natural sweetness & creamy after taste of the uni is most definitely worth the a try.Apart from the food menu, Rakuzen also offers a wide variety of sake, with the option to be served hot or cold. If it could not be finished in one seating, you can always park your bottle of sake there for your next visit.

"Andy22LKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",One of the better Japanese restaurants in town,"I have been to Rakuzen many times either for lunch or dinner and the place has never failed to delight me. It is one of the places in town where the food is pretty close to what you get in Japan. Below is an overview of the place:Menu:There are several different menus to choose from - there is the regular ala carte menu showing a decent variety of typical Japanese fare such as salad, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, grilled seafood, tempura, noodles, beef dishes and hotpot, a lunch/dinner set menu which offers set meals at great value, and a super dining menu which showcases a selection of premium and exotic Japanese food.Pricing:If you were to compare this to the other popular Japanese chain restaurants in town, you will find Rakuzen's prices slightly higher. However, the quality and presentation of dishes at Rakuzen is of a higher standard compared to the others, so this is justified. One thing which the other chain restaurants lack is a set menu, so if you are looking out for a good value meal with some variety, then the set lunch/dinner may just be perfect for you.Service:I find service to be at an acceptable standard. On very busy days, you'd probably need to call the waiter to refill your cup with ocha as they will not be diligently checking your teacup levels. Do expect to wait a bit if you are ordering grilled dishes such as unagi kabayaki or saba/sanma shioyaki. One thing I always look out for when being served is whether the set meals are arranged and served properly in the traditional Japanese manner, eg. placement of chopsticks, positioning of the rice bowl, the soup bowl, etc.Ambience:Rakuzen in Empire Shopping Gallery is decently sized and is fitted out to have an authentic Japanese restaurant feel. Private dining rooms are also available for large groups. The ambience is pleasant and perfect for any occassion from a business lunch to casual dining with family and friends.Show less",4,Reviewed 25 September 2012 ,Rakuzen Japanese Restaurant

"Sharifah SKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Double Cheeseburger, please.","Japanese food is one of our family’s favourites particularly since we believe strongly that Japanese food is light which makes it highly popular amongst dieters. There are at least three members of my family who are dieting at any one time (there are six adult members in my family) so when I was too tired to cook I suggested we go to Rakuzen. We visit Rakuzen perhaps every other month and rarely have we been disappointed. But since three members of the family are dieting, I suggested we order two sets to be shared between three. When the meal arrived my adult son decided that he was going to put off his diet to tomorrow. I looked at the amount of the set meal and decided – yes one was enough to be shared between two. So husband and I ambitiously started our sharing of a bento box set. As I was eating my share I noticed my husband eyeing my plate – he kept asking if I wanted more. Unusually thoughtful of him, I thought so happily I said I could do with some more of the teppanyaki. We finished everything between the two of us. I thought that this was better than our usual visits when we could barely finish everything in the set not because of taste but more because of quantity. This is good I thought as we settled the bill. On our way out I complemented my husband on how thoughtful he was tonight for my well-being. He said,’Oh, I wasn’t being thoughtful.

Hee Ian L,Sunday lunch stumble,"Wanted to have sang har mee and stumble upon this store on the website and decided to give it a try. The restaurant is rather empty when we entered around noon with ample of parking outside. For food, we ordered hainanese chicken rice, kuey teow and sang har mee. The hainanese chicken rice is average at best with the fragrant rice being the key player of the dish. The kuey teow was too salty and the noodle was too thin. The best is the sang har mee which was delicious.For desserts, we ordered ais kacang and durian pao. Ais kacang melted too fast and is far too sweet with not enough quessential ais kacang ingredients and too much jellies inside.Verdict: Definitely would come back to try their other dishes available.Show less",4,Reviewed 3 June 2018 ,The FOOD Tree

"CITI-ONEKuching, Malaysia",Fairly good but Stingy on soup!,The BKT flavor is just fairly good. Meat is well cooked with BKT flavor and nice aroma..but stingy on the soup. Good that the soup doesn't have the sticky thick soy sauce / oyster sauce fIavour. It is also very crowed especially during weekends. Need to go early for certain good parts (such as yuen kuat and sai kuat) as it usually run out fast. Don't expect good service and business is good. Workers expect you to pay and go away urgently after your meal..as they want to clean up for next customer.Verdict: Not highly recommended....can try if you are fine with crowd and you don't take soup like me.

Now if it was just one or two pieces, that would be forgivable-but all of the ribs from our two bowls?? Disappointing really. Even more so from an established BKT shop!We provided feedback to them and they gave us such attitude...it's shocking. Well to be fair it was just one lady who gave us this horrible service. The arguments she gave us were inconsistent and illogical. Not to mention downright rude. She should understand it is a customer's right to provide feedback especially when it was the truth and we paid in full for it! It's not as if we were given a discount or a replacement.The only reason why I'm giving them 2 points out of 5 is because the soup itself was good. Otherwise I'd rate them a negative score if I could especially since they ruined my family's breakfast.Even the soup itself is not a draw for us to return.

Calvin L,Really Mediocre Japanese Food,"We decided to drop by after reading some reviews on this place. The place was easy to spot with a well decorated shop front and the door service was prompt and polite. The impression when we stepped in was awesome, we were welcomed quickly and the ambience was pretty good, with the smell of the grilled food. However, the Rattan chairs are hard and uncomfortable, if you have long hair and rest your head on the chair, it will get caught. So becareful.Overall, the price of the food was on the high side and their plastic laminated menu was not impressive. Showing signs of a cheap family restaurant but charging high prices. RM60 for 2 Miserables slices of Unagi, from Taiwan apparently, as advised by the waitress. Not being too quick to judge, we just ordered and waited for the food. The sashimi came first within 6mins, however the rest of the food came 15mins later. They should serve it back to back and not with such a long interval. The Ramen was a disaster. Do not order this dish. It was horrendous. The noodles we're soggy, soup was tasteless and there's alot of fat floating on the top of the broth, as shown in the photo. #pukesThe Pacific Perch has such a fowl smell when it arrived. Giving it the benefit of doubt, we tried it. The meat does not look fresh as it was very soggy and the meat is extremely salty. After one bite, we told them to remove it from the table as it was very smelly. The Soba was good, but not the tempura. The batter was soggy and soft, and as you can see from the photo, the size of a strand of soba is about the same size as the Prawn Tempura. Lastly the oyako Don was very mediocre and nothing special. Overall, the food quality of this place is really low, I think they really use cheap suppliers and the quality of food is definitely not there when is comes to finishing as well. This meal is highly disappointed and left us dissatisfied, as u can see, we didn't even finish half of our food. That's how bad it was. Maybe a more commercialized Rakuzen would be a much better option for the same price point. The crowd is really local with people in tshirt, shorts and slippers. Definitely not recommended for a business dinner.

"LoiChinKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",So so Sushi,"Located in an isolated area in Subang Jaya, it was dark and scary when we arrived. We hope our vehicles would be safe. Walking up 2 flights of steps, a small door opens up to a cosy restaurant. We were a party of 8 and had a small room to ourselves. It was warm in the room but it was freezing the last time we came, like summer and winter. Maybe it is the change of seasons! We did not enjoy our last visit or food because of the freezing temperature. Now it is hot instead!Being in a room has its advantages but the waiters can't see you if you need them. You have to go out of the room to hail them. A small gadget to hail waiters would be useful.After the order, food came promptly. But as we did not come together, those who order earlier got their food last! A no-no in restaurant service! Breaded pork was too dry. The bread was too crusty and rough. Sushi was average, the rice should be warm. The ramen so-so, with a small naruto floating on its surface. The udon look rubbery, should have been pre-soaked. Our cawanmushi came late after we finished our meals. This could be due to their extensive menu. Wonder how the cooks could master even one dish if not everything in the menu.The green tea was like tea flavoured water. Not like green tea at all.The bill came to RM 60+ each.For this amount, we could have gone to a all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet in Sri Petaling or Old Klang Rod, complete with oysters, of similar or better quality of food.Having been in Japan and eaten in numerous restaurants and stalls there, this restaurant is like a typical ""Tai Chow"" or a neighbourhood restaurant at home. Natives from there who missed home cooked meals will flock to this place. For non-natives, you can have endles list of choice of good Japanese restaurants at reasonable price.Prune down the menu, fix the air-conditioning and install a waiter hailing gadget, and you could go from zero to Jiro!!;Show less",3,Reviewed 19 April 2016 ,Kinpachi Japanese Restaurant

I love the varieties they provide in the menu, as well as the excellent service (they are very attentive to your needs and are always on standby to serve you or help you). Food takes a while to reach your plate but, I don't mind as this means they require time to prepare your food (better perfectly cooked than uncooked). The first thing you'll notice when you arrive at Kinpachi is the number of families (and some Japanese expats). Not entirely ideal for dates as it does get kind of awkward with families staring at you but ideal for a huge group as there are private rooms behind the kitchen. Overall wonderful place!

As the restaurant is quite popular, prior reservations is recommended. The ambience inside the restaurant is pleasant and cozy but quite congested as it is housed in a shop lot. The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant, efficient and helpful. Their menu focuses primarily on Japanese cuisine which costs somewhere between RM60-RM80 per pax. Food is presented elegantly and the quality of their sushi, tempura, unagi, oysters and pork amongst others is worth the high price. As the restaurant is quite small, a group of 10-12 people would be comfortable, a larger group might be quite constraining space wise.

It’s always calming to come to the Saujana, located away from the hustle and bustle of the city.There was a good choice of set lunches at reasonable prices. On this occasion, my lunch partner and I both wanted to avoid rice, and we weren’t great fans of sushi, so we opted for dishes from the a’la carte menu.We started with California rolls before proceeding with mixed sashimi and lovely, tender beef teriyaki, paired with healthy soba.

As I had enjoyed my dinner there (though pricey), I thought weekend buffet lunch would allow me to sample even more of their dishes at a fixed price. What I think pushes Kogetsu a notch up compared to other Jap buffets is that it's ala carte buffet, your orders are freshly cooked. The quality of the sashimi was fresh (5 types to choose from, though we find dinner cuts even better) and you get a variety of cooking styles dishes to choose from grilled, teppan, simmered, deep fry, menrui, rice and rolls etc. This is a pure Jap cuisine buffet, no fillers like local and western dishes to deviate your attention from Jap :-p. Though the price does seem steep (there's 20% discount with major credit cards), I do opined that it's still good value for money.

Sitting at the sideline of the kitchen was like watching a cooking orchestra conducted by the Master chef. The temperature of the flame, clinging sounds of pans, and the fresh cooking smell just made you so excited for your food!I was even more lucky tonight that I spotted the Master was making a brand new bowl of fried rice. Once he finished one batch, I immediately ordered one. Maybe the Chef knew my intention (to try his rice), he immediately made me a brand new bowl! You could notice his sportmanship and showmanship right there and I really appreciated it! Not until I put the fresh fried rice in my mouth, the show went from the kitchen into my mouth! Each rice stands alone by itself yet each one of them are still moist! The bounciness of the rice was incredible! Fried rice is the most basic plate in culinary, but mastering it is like climbing Everest. If the timing and temperature is wrong, the rice would go to a point of no return and not able to be ""rescued"". Either they stick together or burnt. Here at Kogetsu, the Master got it perfectly right! The satisfaction made me smile while I eat, shook hand with the Master, to walking back home. It's a simple bowl of rice, but it made my night!

"AndySenawiSingapore, Singapore",A must stop for the family,"PROS: Food, priceCONS: No reservations availableWHO: 10 pax (2 families from teens to 60s)My introduction to J&C was an enthusiastic brother who wouldn’t stop talking about their pastas and an equally excited mother who, traditionally would prefer to complain about restaurant food being stingy with ingredients, truly enjoyed their fusion of east and west. If mom likes it, I guess they pass the litmus test. I’ve been there twice on the same number of occasions that I dropped by KL. They seem to do a lot of things right. Their Western dishes like pastas and steaks are very much authentic. Al dente noodles and properly done meats, you can’t go wrong with those fundamentals. And so are their Asian dishes. There’s this Chili Crab sauce and fried bun dish which I think is as good as it gets – spicy, sweet and still strangely crab-ish without the crustacean ever making an appearance. You dip your fried buns for a snack that’s good for two or as a starter for four.You should also try their daily specials because the one I got was a generous helping of meat and some noodles. I can’t really tell what it was nor can I remember exactly what I ordered because there were too many dishes the both times we visited. It was glorious though. What I liked most about the place is that it has everything for everyone. Literally. There is something for every persuasion – Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, Italian, you name it. And unlike so many places that do well for a handful of items and then half-hearted versions of the rest, I’m pleased every one of them is a star in its own right. To me, this allows a family’s worth of “I only eat this and not that”or “I don’t eat anything without rice” to be irrelevant because now, everyone has something to enjoy. Jibby used to be a family favourite now it is must stop for us.Show less",4,Reviewed 28 July 2017 ,Jibby & Co

Food arrived quickly and the general consensus was that they tasted good. We ordered the fish n chips, vegetarian spaghetti, seafood spaghetti, the asian rice fare (forget the name), the salmon salad & the jibby big breakie.

It's amazing that without any shortage of staff, a computerized ordering system and even communication device like a walkie talkie can lead to such confusion.To top that off, there is zero wow factor on the food. Portions are small and taste will not hit the spot. And to think about the price they charge with what you're getting, it's absolutely ridiculous. I will not recommend this place to anyone at all.

Tried the lord of shroom pizza and pan seafood with bread. Very good pan seafood and love the combination with the bread. Pizza portion was huge and alot of mushroom on top. They hav a special drink, banofie pie which pretty interesting. Took the valrhona chocolate dessert and it is not very sweet.

"FrhAtqKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",not bad but not impressive,this restaurant does not take reservation so usually patrons will need to be in line to get a table. my friend and i got our seat after 30 minutes waiting but we already expect that. i ordered soft shell crab burger which taste was just okay. the burger is a little on the greasy side because the soft shell crab was deep fried. sweet potato fries that come with it is nice and crispy but i do wish they have added more of the fries portion. my friend ordered the asian chicken maryland and the chicken were cooked well as well as the fragrant rice. service was quick and the servers are friendly. i do feel that this place has pricier food but no long term pull factor for its patron. the decor is nice of course with its rustic interior but i think they are many other restaurants out there in klang valley that have similar interior style. most probably i would not come back again unless i have friend who really wants to go. overall just average.Show less,3,Reviewed 7 November 2014 ,Jibby & Co
"shahirahhKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Another Hipster Cafe?~,"My first visit to the place was with my bff and we had to queued for about half and hour before can get the chance to have a seat in this cafe. We were seated upstairs. The deco and the environment had made a pretty good impression to me. Rustic vintage style that I adore. The architecture of the cafe had shouted out the laid back aura despite the noise made by the full house customers.I catches a glimpse of the cake display racks before heading to our seats upstairs.Looks promising. Checking out the menu, I definitely have to agree with the previous reviews on regards of the pricing for the foods. We just ordered their hotpot of seafood and salmon. The food arrived around 15 min after we ordered. The food turn out fine. Definitely a little more than average but not quite hit the wonderful button. We wanted to try out the cakes and had called up the service to check out the menu for their cakes but sadly they don't have one. Given that our seats is upstairs and i wore heel that time, we both just decided on our selection based on our glimpse earlier.The cake was a Ok but still not quite hitting the great level. Overall, I'll say the food is pricier compare to other hipster cafe. The taste was OK but I'm not that keen or excited to come back.

Seanthu,Not worth going back.,"First look from the outside looks like a restaurant coming up with a fresh new trend. See through glass, great interior. As a chef myself first look at the menu looks interesting but overpriced. Ordered anyways meatball pasta was fairly good so is the fish and chips but soggy fries? Come on...The Moroccan lamb pizza came shortly but it was such a heavy dish for a pizza. So chunky and it didn't really feel like a pizza and was fairly pretentious. I don't want to go into the service personnel as they are non existent the host is useless. Asked if we could call for reservations next week he doesn't have a clue.He then proceeded with his own pace to get us a contact number for the event manager named Zack or jack or whatever.So we gave that ""busy"" person a call. Apparently too busy to answer? Passed to an assistant after waiting for his reply. Assistant said ""er you just go there and order from the menu lah.

"LynnShaneKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Average Jibby,"My first experience here was back in May 2014 (which was a rather disappointing one) and recently I decided to give this place a 2nd try.Service was slow, there was a staff at the entrance assigning you to available tables. As my partner and I preferred to be seated upstairs (non-sharing w other diners), it took them quite some time to get us our preferred table. Finally, we saw a vacant table via the CCTV, but somehow their communication via walkie talkie was unclear and someone else who came later (who was wayyy back in the queue behind us) was assigned to that table for 2 upstairs. Food was rather average. Here are some of the food we've had from my recent and past visits.Salad - Chickpea salad and New Caesar Salad.There was nothing new or superb about it plus the portion was rather skimpy for the price you pay. Salads are priced from RM25-30.Mains - Pizza, meatballs pasta, smoked salmon on baguetteTheir pizzas are okay (worth a try), smoked salmon was rather good but once again, not value for money with the portion served. As for the meatballs pasta, the portion is fair. It was tasty but the meatballs were dry and hard. For all of the mains that we've tried, I can honestly say, I have tasted better, with better value for money serving portions.Prices for mains range between RM25-30+But I've seen the tables next to our's ordering their lamb etc, and it definitely looked appetizing. Interested diners, perhaps you could give this a try? Price is in the range of RM40 & above.Dessert - VolcarameloMy partner was there on a previous corporate occasion and apparently it was a BOMB! So, this time, it was a MUST Order for us. We told the staff that we'd like our dessert after meal. Understandably that this dessert takes quite a while to be served. But after about 30mins of waiting, we decided to check on our order, only to be told it'd take another 15mins. Our honest opinion? The previous staff (which put on a black face all the time whenever we called out to her) forgot to inform the kitchen of our order. Came the dessert. Presentation wise was a big fail. The inner chocolate filiings were already overflowing out from the cake. Otherwise, it would have been a 7/10 for me. I liked the crunchy bottom of the cake. Yet again, portion wise is very disappointing for a dessert that costs RM30 (w/o tax YET).**Note: They do have an extra charge of RM30 if you wish to celebrate your birthday by bringing in your own cake.Show less",3,Reviewed 23 August 2014 ,Jibby & Co

The restaurant is located on GK11 which is right outside of Starbucks. I was quite excited to try out this place. The concept of the restaurant is quite cool! It looks like a glass-green-house concept. The seating areas are on ground floor and the 1st floor. When I was there, the place was quite packed with lunch crowd. They have good spread of menus here; breakfast/brunch, finger food, salad, steak, burgers, pasta, pizza, Asian and off course, dessert.After browsing through the menu, I decided to try out the Soft Shell Crab Burger on Brioche (RM32). Since I was here with a bunch of people, the food took a while to reach us. Anyway I was quite excited to indulge the burger.The soft shell crab was fried well and seemed fresh to me. The seasoning of coating of the soft shell crab is just nice, not to over-powering. They had the Asian coleslaw on the burger buns which tasted pretty normal. Served with sweet potato friends and spicy sauce.We also had Shredded Duck Pasta which was really good! Another pasta dish I had tasted was the Tiger prawn & Blue Swimmer Crab pasta which was good as well. Here are the pictures!The have cakes on display and some looked really yummy. If that doesn't tickle your taste bud, you can always order from the menu. I had the flat white coffee (no pictures sorry!) which was okay.Overall, like the food. Service was good except the food and drinks which arrived late. The seating area on 1st floor (where I was at) is quite warm. Although there are some air-con vents but it feels warm most likely due to the glass house concept. Perhaps a mist-fan will do the trick? Something to really consider about. The desserts and coffee are good as well and decent price.

Roam767452,Gourmet Vouchers,I had lunch here with family last Saturday-20/12/19. I was not satisfied with the manner Kaits restaurant handled my situation. I had vouchers of RM300 and other voucher to collect a bottle of wine and cake. The restaurant had some restriction on the manner to redeem voucher which they claim to be cash voucher. The voucher clearly spelled out that at any point of time there can only be 2 vouchers use for the same reservation. So I suggested to the manager to split the bills where I will pay by my self using 1 voucher and the other 2 vouchers will be use for another bill of 2person. This was decline by the manager. Then I suggested that I will use 2 of the vouchers and collect the wine & cake but the manager decline and said that 'CASH' voucher cannot be use to claim the wine. This was not spelt out at the back of the voucher at all. I visited the same place last year and had lunch with my family and collected the wine without any problems. The manager claimed that the rules have changed since Sept19 but these changes was not informed to members like me. My wife called Gourmet Collection and demanded for an explaination.

"Travelicious_KKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Disappointed,"My friends and I were here for your Ramadhan buffet at the Kites Restaurant. Our original reservation was for 5, but one person could not make it at the very last minute due to genuine circumstances, so it was just the 4 of us in the end. When we walked in we made it very clear to your Manager on duty that only 4 of us were there, so you can imagine our surprise when we were billed for 5 at the end of the night. Your reasoning: It’s your policy to charge us based on our reservations. This is the most ludicrous thing we’ve ever heard. None of us have ever encountered or heard of something like this before. Furthermore, if it was your so-called policy, then one of the following should be in place:1. This policy should be clearly indicated on your website.2. We could have been told about the “policy” when we called to make reservations/when you called us to confirm our reservations.3. Your Manager on duty could have informed us about the “policy” when we arrived.None of the above are in place, so how can you justify charging us for 5 people? Your staff eventually agreed to waive the cost for the 5th person after we argued our points, but at the end of the day, it’s a matter of your principals in handling a situation like this.In addition to that, the fact that your buffet is RM98++ is extremely steep, especially if you are obviously not able to cater to the throngs of people that were they. If all your patrons are being charged the same amount, then each of us should get the same experience. We were seated in a corner, next to the Pump Room, with no proper ventilation. It was extremely stuffy as it was outdoors – there were no fans either. So what I don’t understand is why do we have to pay the same as the other person who gets to sit in an air conditioned room, with nicer tables and chairs? Should each person not get the same experience? In addition to that, the food was nothing to shout about.I am of the opinion that Ramadhan buffets have become a money making scheme for all hotels these days. There’s only one objective in mind: to make as much money during this 30 day period. You wanting to charge us for 5 instead of 4 only reinforces this fact for me.This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I can only assume that the Holiday Inn brand is not at all customer-centered.

Since it was the only Chinese shop opened in the area hence why not check this place out since there has been some word of the food here is a must try.And yes it was a must try once only! We as a family of 3 order 2 big char siew wan tan mee and a small bowl together with 2 kopi ”0” ice and hot Chinese tea, overall food was at best 6/10 would have given more if not for the following1. The wantan was so small with only a spec of meat inside.2. Soup is heavily peppered up which can be to hide its lack of taste and a possible additional additive ”MSG”3. The char siew was awesome however seems to be slightly undercooked by the taste of the fats but it was again heavily masked by the thick char siew sauce.Despite it, all, why this restaurant to me carries a 1 rating is because of the price. In all my total bill was RM35! This kind of price is only acceptable if it was in at least an air-conditioned restaurant but it wasn't and the cleanliness is so so only.I technically feel being cheated eating here the price i paid was not justified base on the food and ambience. Anyways i leave it to you to decide if you are willing to pay so much for so less. Show less",1,Reviewed 9 February 2019 ,Restoran Spring Golden
"pianocelloShah Alam, Malaysia",Small portions ,"I came here to see what the hype was all about. The meat is definitely juicy but certainly not the best in the Klang Valley that some have claimed. Service was reasonably fast and polite. The place can get crowded, noisy and stuffy. The price is marginally higher than similar char siew rice stalls in other kopitiam. I was a little disappointed that compared to similar stalls, they didn't carry eggs and tofu. The portions are small and I felt hungry after eating. I probably will only come again if I absolutely have to be in the area. The turning from the main road is a bit of a nightmare to drive and there are other char siew rice restaurants in the Klang Valley that are just as good.

However, once you walked in, it is packed during lunch time and most of the time, there is a few minutes wait for table. Their char siew is simply deliciously cooked to perfection. It’s slightly charred at the edge with the sweet caramelised taste and the fats literally melt in your mouth. Go earlier or later to avoid lunch crowd and better air ventilation.

Our reservation was recorded but had been booked on a wrong date by the tele-reservation service. It took a while for the staff to sort this out but the experience was disappointing. An hour later, as the flow of patrons grew, so did the spread. The grill section and the desserts offerings looked attractive on this evening, but the regional dishes appeared a distinct second, though not unappetising.

The matcha pudding was good however the serving medium was small and narrow that made it difficult for the teaspoon to scoop up the pudding.

"esthercyt93Subang Jaya, Malaysia",It wasn't worth it..,"My husband and I had Kampachi's Sunday lunch buffer spread. I was very excited but it was a let down. The grilled seafood (crab legs, flower crabs, river prawn) was so dry and mushy which tells us it's not fresh and frozen to a point I thought I was watching Frozen 3. RM6 for a cup of green tea? That's a rip off. The overall buffet spread wasn't up to par as choices of food are limited. The place that we sat was warm and could hardly feel the air-conditioner. The only thing that salvaged the dining experience was the young teppanyaki chef who cooked our beef perfectly, fresh sashimi platter and that friendly chef who served us a bowl of teriyaki beef bowl (stationed next to the seafood grill). We didn't even bother to ask for the complimentary Birthday dessert and decided to leave. The price that we pay, was not worth it at all.

geegee-pei,Overrated and lousy weekend lunch buffet. Overpriced and below par food served,"Went there last Sunday for their weekend lunch buffet for rm148. I was there couple weeks ago for business lunch and it was good and subsequently recommended by the manager -Edward to try out the weekend lunch,boasting slipper lobster and snow crab for the price of rm148 per month. What a disappointment! Although it's a buffet spread, given the price, the restaurant ought to prepare more fresh food for the customers. Lobster and snow crab was not fresh and so dry. None of us enjoy it at All! Ordered medium done teppanyaki beef and the meat was tough. The teppanyaki salmon was so dry and we couldn't eat it at all. Basic food ie fried food such as tempurara was equally bad. Over fried. Even the fruits - watermelon, grapes and honey dew were not fresh and some of the grapes had turned sour! The only thing that was edible was the unagi,sukiyaki. For the piece I've paid to bring the whole family there (spent rm610; bear in mind rm148 buffet doesn't include green tea which they charged additional rm6 per pax),i could have a way better and decent Japanese meal elsewhere. I will not visit again. In fact, given the obvious double standard and extreme food quality served during ala Carte and buffet,I will not patronize even for ala carte meals as I've felt totally cheated.Note :didn't even bother taking much pics of the food since it was not worth remembering.Show less",1,Reviewed 22 May 2019 ,Kampachi Plaza33

341angelinesMalaysia,Sunday lunch buffet,"I have dined in this restaurant several times (at least 4-5 times this year) for their Sunday lunch buffet, and I have several comments:PROS:1. Firstly, great food. No complaints in regards to the freshness of the sashimi. Variety of food is good, so for some who don't fancy raw foods, the cooked foods section is more than adequate to please. Although from my experience the tempura prawns or the miso halibut seem to run out pretty quickly, it is quite quickly restocked.2. Making reservation is highly recommended as I have seen this restaurant when it's full-house. It does get pretty busy on some SundaysCONS:I absolutely hated sitting at the ""bird's nest"" seats near the entrance. During my last 2 visits to the restaurant, I was given those seats, much to my frustration. When I first sat there, I immediately noticed that the air-conditioning was bad at that section and I started sweating even before the meal. I wanted to request to change tables immediately, but of course, no waiters were allocated to take care of the section. Instead, most waiters were posted at the inner main seating area. Waving at waiters who were all standing so far away didn't worked. Hence, after a few minutes of frustration, I walked to the entrance to speak to the staff for a table change. I was told the ""bird's nest"" seats were for small groups and that the main area is only for large families (not true, by the way. I previously sat in the main seating area even though it was just me and my fiance). As I didn't want to make a fuss, I attempted to settle down at that miserable section. When I was finally ready to order a pot of tea, again my attempts at gaining the attention of the waiters failed. Due to the design of the seats & table, it was hard for waiters to see my waving hands; and of course all the waiters were at the main seating area. Again, I had to get up and walk to the main entrance to tell the staff that I want to order tea, and again, I requested to change tables because this is just ridiculous. Again, I was refused. As a consolation, I was given a buzzer-type device so that I can call for the waiter. During that same visit, I saw other patrons who sat at the same section getting frustrated too with the lack of attention from waiters. One family even took their pile of dirty plates and placed it directly at the bar counter as their table was not cleared.As for my most recent visit on 29th July 2018, I immediately requested for a table at the main area after being led to this awful section. My request was denied. This time, I immediately told the waitress I want the buzzer device as I don't see any waiters in this section of the restaurant. Anyway, the area was still hot with weak air-conditioning. But what made me really irritated was when I saw several other tables in the main seating area with 2 patrons only. How is it that some patrons get to sit in the more comfortable main area, and my requests for table-change was denied in 2 visits? These past 2 experiences were truly awful, but only because I had to eat while being sweaty and getting irritated from the lack of attention from staff.Over all, my biggest advice is to go there for the food only. Service and seating-wise, they are subjective and depends on your luck. Obviously, ambience is totally 0% if you have the misfortune of being seated near the entrance (Imagine being sweaty and waving your hands around like a monkey just to get the waiters' attention, which was what I did).Show less",3,Reviewed 4 August 2018 ,Kampachi Plaza33

Unfortunately, I ended up ordering the wrong thing - I wished it could have been explained and I ended up with a really small miserable piece of fish. The staff there look fed up and impatient- and its quite clear that they sorely lack training. When we asked for refills of green tea we often got long sour faces.

After being on my feet and cycling through different buses all day; touring the friendly and fabulous town of Klang, I needed to re-energize, achieve a comfortable rest, and most importantly have a tasty meal. I came to visit a shopping mall, 'Aeon'. After reading and acknowledging a confident and positive review on the popular restaurant 'Deli Rich', I found the review and or the description of the restaurant to be perfect for me. As I entered the restaurant, I was welcomed by the friendly staff of Deli Rich wearing their bright orange T-shirts, their sweet looking smiles and the two words ""salamat dating"" which after they realised I was not a local they translated it to English as ""Welcome"". I was then escorted to a table, my chair was pulled out for me, and I was given a menu. Looking at the menu; I noticed a broad variety of traditional cultural meals, Asian, Western , Italian , Chinese and Japanese. There was also a wide range of drinks ranging from hot to cold. To add to this, the prices were very affordable although beinglocated in a well known popular main shopping all. I decided to eat and therefore ordered the traditional Malaysian meal 'Nasi Ayam' (chicken rice). After a quick wait of approximately 10 minutes, my meal came to me freshly hot on a nice unique plate and with cutlery. The mouth watering Nasi Ayam consisted of steamed rice, roasted chicken, soy sauce and chilli sambal.

Thanks to Jacquelyn we were given a cozy private room. We ordered the Jasmine set. A few months back I had this set with another group of friends and enjoyed all the dishes served. This time, however, I was disappointed. Except for the salmon appetizer, all the other dishes were overly salty. Perhaps, the main chef has changed or was off duty on that day. My friends who had never dined here before commented that they would never eat in this restaurant again. I do like this restaurant though as the service is excellent and ambience is nice.

"kittylitter88Kota Bharu, Malaysia",Truly in its own class!,"I went for dinner here on Monday, 13 April with family. Even on Monday it was full house, I can't imagine coming here on the weekend!Service - was swift and attentive as the servant offered baby chair when he saw our toddler was sitting on the adult chair. Menu spread was very informative & image-heavy.Food - I think the potato + leek soup was way delicious than the mushroom soup as an appetizer. Garlic bread was not crunchy, a bit stale. But I've always assumed baguette as stale (LOL). I've had medium well sirloin steak (8oz) and it was very delicious, tender and melted right in my mouth! It was probably the BEST STEAK I've ever had compared to other pricey restaurants that weren't consistent. Black pepper sauce was too strong on its own but when paired with the steak, the taste was divine. They used Australian beef apparently; side salad was fresh & crunchy. However, the side potato cake was so-so; cold, very starchy and felt like it was made earlier in the day. Frutti di mare was delicious too! The spaghetti was al dente; not overcooked & still have a bite to it. It's quite a big portion also so you may share! My sis-in-law had the chicken chop and she commented the side pie was a letdown. I guess this restaurant focused too much on the main star of the dish (i.e the protein) that it forgot the side dishes were important as well. Didn't order dessert because I was so full!

When I asked for steak knife, the waiter brought me another bread knife, only to explain that that’s the ‘knife’ we serve for steak. Nothing special about the taste and the presentation were so-so. The steak was tough and using the bread knife only made it worse. Some other RM15 steak restaurant can easily done better. We ordered lasagna as well. I can assure you that even the pizza hut’s lasagna taste better! Its soggy, small portion for the price, and the mozzarella topping had ‘hardened’ when it served on our table.

Was all good as we got a table nearby the open air balcony. Half way through our meal, they sat a couple adjacent to our table (arms' length) and they started smoking. Initially, i was still obliging even though their smokes were blowing towards us. It was when i saw the smoke ashes landed on my table and food that i stopped eating, told the waitress what happened and requested for a change of table. She listened, wipe the ashes on the table with her hand and walked away. We waited and then, stopped another waiter for the same request. He then said ok and walked way.. We caught up with him again after several minutes and his response was, we would have wait for a while since there is no table available. Noting that the restaurant was only around 60% occupied by then. We requested for the manager.. The same waiter came back without the manager and kept repeating that we would have to wait for table change. At this point, we had to raise our voice before the manager finally came to our table. So, within minutes of explaining, we got a new table. We finished our food within 10 minutes and left. The restaurant should have a clear segregated area of smoking and non smoking dining. Despite the ribs may be good, they seemed to think smoke ashes onto customer food is not an issue and attempted to sideline us into putting up with the crap, just because they want to reserve empty tables for other potential customers.

Food was good however the service was so so which made my business lunch...disappointed!Here's what happened on 20 June 2019:1. I called about 1130am to make a reservation. I was told to call back at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be taken when the restaurant opens. Hello...this is a 5 star hotel! 2. I contacted one of the managers at the hotel and she was kind enough to help make the reservation. Since this was a business lunch, I want to be prepared. The reservation was made. 3. When we walked into the restaurant at 1210pm, two staff were at the front and some at the Sushi bar. None of them greeted us. I have to inform them I have made a reservation. I thought the restaurant opens at 12pm! 4. I asked the waitress what was the Gunkan promotion, the colorful menu was on the table. The waitress said she doesn't know. Omg! 5. My business partner got his California Temaki, then his Gindara set. But...Where's my Sashimi set??? I asked the waitress..Then...3rd came the Gunkan. I have to ask again and again when was my Sashimi set since my other guest has already halfway into his Gindara set. It's about 15min later I got my Sashimi set. I think Miyabi has coordination issue, it's out of sync. Furthermore, the waitress need to be trained to be able to answer questions about the menu.

Yes. It was. This recent Saturday dinner reflected contemporary Japanese dishes (ryōri) was filled with friends' sharing enjoyment, food elegance and ambience (all about 雅).Last not the least, the stone-grilled Wayu, stone-grilled chef specail seafood, and the Omakase soup, which did high-light this fabulous evening and dining.MIYABI do span a wide spectrum from friend/family dining rather than the intricate Kaiseki ryōri (懐石料理).Salute to you to bring in this different MIYABI reflect from Chefs and high attentive serving staffs.Show less",5,Reviewed 15 April 2019 ,Miyabi

"ECKLKualaLumpurKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Less is More Part 352 - Complacent Clumsy Cloddish Communication ,"First of all, for a hotel that has been in operation for a year (I was told by a manager), there are still bothersome inconsistencies between its online communication and what’s on the ground. I’m surprised no one noticed it. It started with our intention to have lunch here on New Year’s Eve. Having ‘heard’ of the stunning rooftop views, I checked the website to note that rooftop Sala was open for lunch and dinner. When we arrived at the main lobby, we double-checked with front desk and was informed that we could order a la carte lunch in Sala. Reaching the rooftop, it became apparent that it was certainly not set up to serve meals. We asked the barman and was told that Sala only had snacks. So we trekked back downstairs to look for a lunch alternative. It was by default that we ended up at Miyabi. The environment is quite elegant and beautifully decorated with stunning black and white marbles. While it positions itself as 5-star, in reality the service level manages no more than 4. The sushi chefs all look like foreign workers and I don’t mean Japanese. The servers appear to be fresh out of hospitality school. Very polite nonetheless but awkward and inexperienced. We ordered the sushi/udon and sashimi sets, a tempura udon and the December special lobster tempura with yuzu butter. The food was served at different intervals. Given the low lunch traffic when we were there, there should not be any excuse not to serve the three meals together. There is nothing extraordinary about the food - very regular and run-of-the-mill. Aside from an above average chawanmushi, the rest was actually below. In fact the various cuts of seafood on the sushi was so disproportionately thin compared to the rice it sits on, it’s embarrassing. And we had to wait and wait for the lobster tempura - that came out long after we had finished our main meal. Were they defrosting it? The tempura batter turned out doughy and greasy. Dessert was fruit slices that had obviously been sitting in the refrigerator. Is it so difficult to cut them fresh?With the proliferation of Japanese restaurants around town offering such high quality and authentic food, a reputable establishment like Sheraton should not settle for what they have right now. Quite disappointing. Show less",3,Reviewed 1 January 2019 ,Miyabi

"rcaustin9161Clawson, Michigan","Amazing Food, High Cost Upselling & Terrible Service","Have been to Miyabi twice this year and similar experiences both times.Start with the food - amazing! Tried different things from Sashimi to grilled beef, grilled salmon to tepanyaki - all delicious and fresh. Highly recommend the food.Now the upselling - first time the waiter recommended a mix of Sashimi, a steak and a bit more - the bill was nearly 500 MYR in food alone for one person. Buyer be ware - he sells nicely but never mentions the cost. This time in June was there for a work event post workshop with 10 people. Had a budget so we fixed a menu in advance. First waiter comes in, knows we have the set menu, asks if we would like drinks. All is good. The second waiter comes in (same guy from first visit) and starts trying to upsell sashimi appetizers, offering specials for meals and getting my guests excited. Needless to say I am furious as I have to be the bad guy and turn all this down, losing face to some of the colleagues as ""why is the company being cheap"". Then after I stated that we had the set menu, he asks ""are you sure you don't want to add to it?"". Unacceptable.Service - 4 of us ordered beers. 2 came. 1 came 10 minutes later. Had to ask for the 4th beer after 15 more minutes. No apology. Ordered a second round. Same thing - delivered the beers one by one and took over 30 minutes to get 5 beer. I had to go and find the upselling waiter to demand to know what is going on - received a quick sorry sorry - and again said this is unacceptable - why can't you deliver draft beers together - to which no answer was given. Final round and for the final time, they could not manage to deliver all at once. No process improvement, no care, no concern. No round of drinks for free, no acknowledgement there was a problem from them.They did manage to constantly refill the green tea, but as soon as the meal was done, no more green tea while we continued talking (and waiting on the beers).

I found it rude, both times that I was there when they just came up to the table and wanted to take away the plates. Only one waiter had the courtesy to ask if it was okay for him to clear the empty platesI mean, it's like they are chasing you away and not happy that you are there.

I was here over the New Year weekend and the restaurant was swamped. The day before New Year's Eve, we had ordered an ala carte dinner - the sup ekor was awesome and the mee mamak was worthy of a second specific visit. New Year's itself was a bit of a circus, the restaurant was slammed but things still ran pretty much clockwork. Nothing to complain but was just ordinary.Came back this weekend when it was less busy, and boy, the service just shone through. The team is utterly attentive and happy to wait on you hand and foot. Every time we passed, theyd greet us with a smile, and some even remembers me and greeted me by name. The food was also amazing, especially their local menu (I find the western stuff just normal, but Paya Serai is known for their local fare). A big shoutout to the amazingly awesome team at Paya Serai - Mustaffa, Linda, Shahrol, Rizal, Kalpana, Rohini, Azlina, Teja and Irma who took such good care of me over the two stays.

leecam156,Disappointing Hi Tea Buffet!,"I just attended the Hi Tea Buffet today and I am very very disappointed. Firstly, for a high ‘tea’ buffet, there wasn’t even any tea served! No option of any drinks besides water! Even a simple bed and breakfast would have at least orange juice as standard. This is appalling! Secondly, there was very limited options. I have been to many other hi tea buffets and this is perhaps one of the most limited options I have experienced! If mco and less crowd is the reason then perhaps the price should also be reduced accordingly. But instead, the price is exorbitant for such a spread. And my guest had to wait 20 mins for a satay to be served! The roast lamb on display was almost left with only bones at only 1pm! My other guest who is a vegetarian had very limited options.

Eventually our orders came but we were distracted by the commotion next table: a waiter was berated for slowness in delivery as the group unlike ours was there for office lunch and they waited a mite too long. Poor waiter.Our orders albeit the wait was actually very good especially the bamboo briyani which came in a platter of bamboo rice (in a real bamboo) and a sizeable chunk of scrumptious lamb. So was the nasi ulam, a healthy meal of rice, chicken and fresh greens.I settled for the cajun chicken sandwich to avoid guilt.And since it was a birthday lunch, a slice of delicious chocolate cake was presented on the house.Best of all, our vouchers entitled us to have a hearty lunch for four at only RM30!Perhaps during the MCO, Paya Serai should insist that guests who booked the lunch hour must pre order, or risk waiting long.Show less",3,Reviewed 17 September 2020 ,Paya Serai

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",FIRST ONLINE ORDER,"Every Ramadan, we decided to eat simple, content with pasar malam takeaways, and never allowing a full meal to affect the blessed month of fasting and praying. But the last day of fasting was always at Paya Serai as there was no rush to go for terawih prayers and we indulged after a month of abstinence.But 2020 was a challenge due to the MCO and we thought we had to forgo this experience. But no, PJH offered online orders of different menus during Ramadan and Syawal, and we ordered one set after the 6 days of puasa enam ie Ramadan and Syawal fasting obligations over!And my what a set it was. Priced at slightly above rm300, we got the following Hari Raya delicacies: nasi briani with ayam panggang percik,dendeng, mutton briani, sweet sour fish, sambal prawn and vegetables, laksa johor, lontong, ketupat and lemang with rendang and serunding chicken and beef, murtabak ayam plus desserts of french pastries, pineapple tart, bread and butter pudding and kuih raya. It was meant for five people and there were only four of us. So with the help of the freezer, we stretched out the meal over three days!Best dish? All voted for the scrumptious laksa johor, but the rest of the food was great tasting as well. it was a bargain as we did not have to finish everything in one sitting but we were also mindful of the advisory attached to the Hilton bag regarding duration of keeping the food fresh and consumable.Paya Serai, you outdid yourself and kudos to the Chefs, it was a fantastic gastronomic journey that reminded us that Hilton delivers, even in trying times.

They have a very extensive choice of dishes on their Buffets, catering for all tastes. Unusually authentic local dishes available too, in addition to some more Western Dishes. The food is excellent, and the service [mostly] too. There were one or two surprises, I had Dinner with my wife on Thursday and paid RM 146.54. Two days later, on Saturday I had an identical Dinner, except that this time I was being charged RM 227.58. I am not sure whether there is a surcharge for dining on a Saturday [why?] as the food buffet was exactly the same as two days earlier.

"SuSankar1999Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Christmas eve buffet dinner- a letdown,"Recently, a friend and i went for the much hyped Christmas Eve buffet dinner at Paya Serai in PJ Hilton. I used to come here a lot a few years ago due to the selection and great tasting food. Unfortunately, the reputation has taken a severe beating in my opinion. The food selection was poor and limited. While they had the usual turkey and the trimmings (which to be fair, was nicely done) the rest of fare was quite disappointing. The taste of some of the dishes was surprisingly bad with some par ingredients. When some of the dishes ran out, it was not replenished. For a buffet service, it doesn't make sense to not replenish an item that was finished an hour and a half before the buffet closes. The dessert counter was quite pathetic and those that were served could have been given more attention during preparation. All in all, the whole thing was a waste of money. Would not recommend it again. On the plus side, The few staffs that were around, were very friendly and kind. But having said that, they were too few people working the tables. We even talked to other patrons who were trying to get someone to clear the plates and replenish water and there was only 1-2 staffs doing that. Perhaps, the mgmt should really look at restoring paya serai and other parts of of the hotel (service wise) to its glory days.Show less",3,Reviewed 26 December 2018 ,Paya Serai

However, we did our best at Paya Serai, and it helped that they had a wide variety of Malaysian food (Indian, Malay, Chinese, Western, etc), the food was delicious and good quality - various meat dishes, crab, good ice-cream (chocolate, green-tea and strawberry). There were many other diners, but it didn't feel crowded. The food was always easy to access.Paya Seri kindly brought over a piece of cake for my brother in law's birthday! They even had a clown and took some photos of the family for us.

For some reason the hotel chose to put their trainees manning the food stations. BBQ items (lamb, beef, sausages) are not prominently displayed and r instead hidden on the back counter like they hope no one will see it and order it. Anyway it’s cooked so badly right before your eyes so u might not want to eat the rubberized meat anyway. The only thing worse was the pasta station which I have no words for. What I can say is the carbonara looked like cream soup. How can an established hotel think it’s ok to put trainees in in a weekend? On top of that, dishes were slow to be re filled. Better off ordering in KFC instead. Show less",2,Reviewed 16 December 2017 ,Paya Serai

It's not that it's bad-it just isn't great and for the name and the price that's not really good enough. On entering the buffet it looks like there's a lot on offer. However, once you've been around a couple of times, you start struggling. The dishes all have a certain blandness that is fairly typical of major hotels in KL. As all locals and residents know even the cheapest roadside stall will give you tastier local food. The international sections are also a bit disappointing. They look appetizing up to a point, but taste-wise there's always something missing. Might as well pop into Uncle Chillis for some western food with a bit of oomph!So, as usual our large group left wondering why we'd done it to ourselves again.

There are only two types of soup served, mushroom soup and si chuan soup. Sichuan Soup was starchy, but I liked the mushroom soup which was pretty authentic. Drinks are not inclusive inside the buffet price, therefore you have to place order with the servers. Service was relatively slow and the air conditioning vent was not working at the corner we were sitting. I was practically sweating while I eat. The main saving grace was the chocolate fountain in the middle of all the food served. You can dip the marshmallows, fruits in chocolate, which was quite fun.

"lalalyzzPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",A Let Down,"My family and I were here earlier for their iftar/ dinner buffet. Well. Now. I have a lot to say. First: The crowd: Glutton and I must say, almost barbaric. It was as if they couldn't grasp the concept of attending a buffet. There was no system and everywhere I looked the place was nothing but an eye sore. Kids were minging everywhere. Second: Foods were not replenished immediately. The guests had completely emptied some of the dishes 10 minutes into the buffet. Third: Plates were only available at 2 sections. At one point I wanted to get hold of some lamb curry that was located near the cashier. I had to hustle through the crowd all the way to the back to get a plate. I don't mind the wait & the walk. But like I mentioned earlier, the crowd could easily get on your nerves. Fourth: Plates, glasses & cutleries had stains on them. Also. When we arrived, we were short of cutleries & napkins. Fifth: most of the servers ignored us. There was a nice Nepalese lad, Deniya, the only one who never failed to attend to us. Sixth: when I asked the staff where to get certain dishes, they didn't know which was which and were just as completely lost as I was. Seventh: Upon payment, we were asked how many of us showed up. (We initially booked a second table for our dear Mom and her friends. We cancelled it before the buffet since the crowd was inappropriate for a reunion. They had their dinner at Genji, a Japanese restaurant on the first floor). When we said 3 (only my sister, myself, and my brother were evidently present), the cashier, Azuna or something, snickered and condescendingly asked ""3..? Really? Are you sure? 3 of you?"". To each of that we nicely answered yes and nodded harder than a bobblehead. I wasn't having it. I went, ""Don't you believe us? Don't you need to have trust in your customers should you wish to earn it from them?""She did apologise afterwards when she gave us our change. We didn't leave our tip there. We tipped the servers in person. And so should you. Eighth: Food: I wish I didn't have to do this. But honestly, it's merely decent here. Nothing was good. If you're looking for a traditional cuisine be it Indian, Malay, Chinese, it's not worth it. Ninth: Cleanliness:The worst part was the arrangement. Floor & food stations were dirty, there were food bits and spills everywhere. Utensils were oily and disgusting. Again this reflects back on the customers as well. Drinking glasses were placed upward (unhygienic). There were plenty of used glasses amongst the clean ones. Again, the crowd. Tenth: buffet for 3 was RM 357. I don't think it should be that expensive given the food quality & service weren't up to our expectation. Eleventh: Parking basement: Looks sketchy. A complete maze. If you have thyroid and failing eyes like me, you're not gonna enjoy circling around the narrow maze. The building is basically just old and hasn't been renovated.Our huge car couldn't manoeuvre around certain corners. (We are fatties. Hence the cruiser)Twelfth: Parking is expensive here. RM 18 per entry. Everyone was given an RM 8 discount. Nice gesture. But looking at the parking bay, you'll be blown away. Some were upset to find out the parking fee. They had that 'yong soi' (black face) look on them. Despite everything I've mentioned, I was here a few times years ago. The last was 2 years ago. Buffet was better then. Maybe à la carte's better here. Who knows. I'm not gonna give it a try.Show less",1,Reviewed 4 July 2016 ,Paya Serai

Kudos to the culinary team for their excellent choices and skills as well as in ensuring every dish was freshly refilled and stale remainders quickly removed.The service team was generally attentive but could do with a little more attention to detail as there were incidents of food mislabeling i.e. fish was labeled as a vegetable, etc.Also, it is strange to charge diners separately for drinking water as there was only coffee and tea included in the buffet. If it was too much trouble for service staff to keep refilling glasses, maybe it would be easier to just make available water decanters or dispensers for self-service.Overall, Paya Serai offers a respectable representation of great Malaysian dining experience... delicious food, great service and homey ambience.Show less",4,Reviewed 12 February 2016 ,Paya Serai

tkzrea,Not as great as what it used to be,"I do come to this restaurant quite often, previously for business lunches but now usually for a business drinks only. Sometimes I have the family here to dine for their buffet here which has been almost an well known attraction of this restaurant for many years (I am talking about at least 20 years). Up until recently, I have always thought the food was above par but now I have come to believe that it is now just average in taste, especially when one considers the prices they charge being a restaurant in a five star hotel i.e. The Hilton. The standards and taste have dwindled over the years and as a regular patron, you come to realize this quite quickly. In fact, whilst having to relax at the lounge recently, I decided to ask for on the menu pepperoni pizza and what they served me was a small plain pizza topped with sliced frankfurters. I don't think this should come from a 5-star hotel.Nevertheless, I must say the ambience is still cozy, despite having a lobby that is usually filled with people. The service provided by the staff there is also very good. Unfortunately, there are times you get smokers in the lounge which is located in front of the restaurant. For some reason, the management do not discourage them from smoking, but to be fair, this occurrence appears to be lesser now. On the overall, this restaurant and the lounge in front of it do provide services which is of acceptable standards. I would probably patronize the lounge again as it is a very convenient place to have a business discussion; given the nice set up. However, this may not be enough to persuade me to bring my guests or family for a meal any longer since the quality of the cuisines and the presentation have not kept up with present standards. One must consider that there are many other restaurants to choose from in that area given the prices this restaurant charges, and unless the management does something to improve it, I am afraid their patrons will be limited to mainly their hotel guests; which may not be aware of the presence of nearby restaurants.Show less",3,Reviewed 21 December 2015 ,Paya Serai

In fact assorted Malay kuih were placed behind the chocolate fountain (opposite side of the table), giving you the impression it is part of the chocolate fountain fare.Also I felt one or two dishes could have been categorized better (e.g. Chicken soup with Chinese herbs placed under Malay section as well as lamb soup commonly found in Mamak outlets).Show less",3,Reviewed 11 December 2015 ,Paya Serai

WanderlenMalaysia,A buffet nothing to shout about,"There are not many hotels in PJ and I wasn't surprised to find the coffee house crowded to the brim with many families with some obviously celebrating some special events. I managed to get a reservation for the 2nd session starting from 3 to 5 pm. Although it was the 2nd session, I could see many trays were empty but they replenished them fast too. There was a wide range of local food served ranging from Indian, Chinese although the western menu was limited to pasta and lamb. The dining area is huge and I don't blame the staff for feelling overworked. One female waitress was particularly looking very dourly while a male waiter was more attentive. The food was nothing fantastic but it sure did the job of keeping us full. The price per pax was RM75++ in the weekend.

Prior to the visit, I called and make a reservation for 3 adult and 1 children with a baby chair. Around 1230 I arrived at the restaurant and then I proceed to my reserved table. I put the baby chair at the space beside my wife and suddenly a lady come to me and said, Sorry Sir.. Please remove the baby chair back at the first location because this is a walkway for hot item. I said, OK.. please relocate my table to a safer place for me to have a dine and safer place to put a baby chair, she said cannot since all the table has been reserved. Unfortunately, there are a table at the rear portion without any reservation. I remain the baby chair and walk away to view the variety of food. Then, the Captain Mustafa came to me and said, Sir we will not responsible if anything happen to your child. I stick with my stand and asked them to relocate our table. I said that I am not the walk-in customer, I have make a reservation and you should know that I request a baby chair and it is your responsible to ensure the safety of my child and my family by put my table at the safer location in the restaurant.

maymaymieMalacca,"Poor Service, Mediocre Food, and Expensive Parking at Paya Serai High Tea Buffet","Bad experience at Paya Serai High Tea Buffet today. The service is appaling. We arrived 15 minutes early for their weekend high tea buffet which starts at 12.30pm. There was no one manning the entrance, so I walked in to find someone. There were plenty of waitress and kitchen staff walking around but no one bothered to greet and ask for your reservation or seat you down. Few other guests were also walking around waiting to catch the attention of someone to direct them to their tables. Finally I approched a waitress who lead me to my reserved table. Once seated, you are left alone, they don't ask if you'd like iced water, nor automatically bring you iced water (unlike other hotels). 30 minutes into our meal we were still not served any water, and my husband had to flag a waiter down to ask for water for the table. Tables were slow to be cleared, even when there were at least 3 servers at our section. So we just stacked our dirty plates on top of each other. The buffet spread was mediocre. Not much choices and mediocre in quality. There was no seafood section at all, no oysters, prawns, crabs, scallops, mussels on ice etc....there was no japanese or italian section either. The chinese food was very disappointing, the Malay section was the best among all. Dessert ice cream was terrible. They only served those cheap local ice cream in chocolate, strawberry and yam flavour. Do not expect premium gelato quality ice cream here. Surprised a 5 star Hilton hotel serves this kind of ice cream... Shangrila and Mandarin Oriental all serve premium gelato quality ice creams at their buffets.Lastly, parking is super expensive here. We parked for less than 2 hours, and it was RM15. When settling the bill, we gave our parking tickets for validation, but the waiter said it's a flat rate today (Saturday), so no validation is necessary. I think RM15 flat rate for 1 hour plus of parking is ridiculous. We had 2 cars at our table so the parking fee was RM30, which in my opinion is very expensive. Even parking in hotels in the middle of KL city is much cheaper, normally around RM8 for 2 hours of parking, their restaurant dining flat rates are also around RM8, certainly not RM15.Conclusion, poor service, mediocre food, and expensive parking... do not waste your time here.Show less",1,Reviewed 17 August 2013 ,Paya Serai

Then on to the main course, had tried everything in small portions as to minimize wastage, wow I must say the chefs have a salty palate, as most of the food is salty even the biryani rice, and the western section everything was tasteless accept the lamb.

RicphunSg petani,Came hungry and left without eating much,"We were having a pharmaceutical talk on 13th of April, 2013 that was held in the hotel by a well known drug manufacturing company and the talk finished about 8.30 pm. Dinner was arranged by the drug company at the Paya Serai that serves buffet style. Being a 5 stars hotel, of course we were delighted to have dinner there and we happily went there. There was less then 100 of us and there were other dinners that were there so I would say they got a good crowd all most full house. We got to the tables seated and started the first round of food by the group. When I reached the fresh sea food behind about 10 people the shrimps or prawns were all snapped up. Well ok, its a Hilton, we thought they will refill so we ate other things which not really a good variety. Soon even the satay corner people were lining up waiting and the best part is some satay looks raw to me and they were being served, I guess there were a lot of hungry people even that were snapped up. Then finally shrimps were refilled so I managed to get about 10 pieces and all snapped up again. So I enjoyed my shrimps and finished hoping to get another helping but no refill time again, tiring of waiting I ask a staff and should be a senior staff as he wears the black coat to my surprise he told me that they were out of shrimps. Well too bad went back to my table they were 8 of us and 6 of them said they didn't even got a chance to eat even one shrimp so I gave up and went for desserts and the ice cream texture is like soft cream served at Mc Donnalds which means the ice box was not working well to keep the ice cream firm.So in the end the only conclusion we had was well its normal for buffet to keep food ratio of 30 paxs to a 100 paxs capacity so that more profits for the outlet as in buffets we pay per head count and if you didn't eat much that's not their problem.Show less",1,Reviewed 15 April 2013 ,Paya Serai

The pilau rice was rather bland, the crab soup was very salty, a few trays were not replenished and there wasn't fresh seafood such as oysters, mussels or prawns usually found in other hotel buffets.

You just eat up all of the baby crabs, shell and all, as they crunch in your mouth.

"syanaz1988Shah Alam, Malaysia",Blissful Wedding!!!,"I had my wedding here back on December 2014 and its a blissful as well as blessful one for me and my husband. The food was great, they served arabic dishes according to what we had chose from the package that they had set for us and our guests. In Malay wedding we have this tradition called ""Makan Beradab"" where the bride and groom eat at a special table with only parents/siblings/relatives are favorable to sit with them and were treated like King and Queen the entire day. The food served for makan beradab was more than I had expected. I thought they would only have lambs and chickens but to my surprise we also had seafood like clams and shrimp cocktail as complementary. The entire decoration for my wedding stage and interiora are at their best, I gave them 8.5/10. Except my make up is a bit mess which the make up artist they hired had drawn my lips makes it look wide and odd which had spoilt my mood a bit. Overall it is perfect!!!

At the stall, you can have a choice of noodles - beehoon, keuh tiaw, yellow mee or a combination of the noodles. The standard top up is curry chicken, but other top up such as yong tau foo (fish ball, brinjal, chilli, fried wanton and foo chuk) can be added to customized your own curry mee. Long beans are then added to the curry mee, while chilli can be taken separately in small plastic sauces.The curry gravy is thick and aromatic, with a generous addition of coconut milk, and smells nice. The gravy is also slightly oily, and the health conscious might think twice about eating this. But I guess to have such a nice and delicious curry mee once in a blue moon is ok.The curry mee with the standard curry chicken costs RM 5.00 per bowl, while add-on will cost separately.Show less",4,Reviewed 3 October 2014 ,Chicken Cuisine Noodle House

"haneeakadirSubang Jaya, Malaysia",A pleasant surprise ,"The place looked like any other current hipster cafes we see around. That is until you taste their food.. and that is when you will get pleasantly surprised. We ordered the beef burger and the salted egg yolk chicken chop. First, let me start with the fact that their burger size was definitely worth the price and the wedges that they served it with, was crispy and had a good texture and taste to it. It was also a nice portion which means you wont be wasting food nor are you going to be left wanting for more. So thumbs up to the chef and owner for being considerate in this meal. The salted egg yolk chicken chop was served with a nice portion of the gravy and was not overpowering as what you might think when it comes to salted egg yolk. Again here the size of the meal was just nice to make sure that it is not gluttony in nature. The latte was served in a nice cup just enough to leave you with a nice taste after a good meal. Kudos to the barista as well on this. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised of how good the food, coffee, staff and environment was during this Sunday dinner.

Then why do you initially tell us you will cancel the order? We had one bite at one of the meatball and spat it out. The vege was so sour none of us could even swallow even the meatballs was so salty like a whole pack of salt poured into the meatball. We gave our comments and they brush it off with next time you can ask for less spicy, etc. But the main thing we pointed out it was so salty, we asked them to even taste it themselves. We are fine to pay it but they are unable to take critism at all pointing out this is how Pakistani cuisine is like. FYI one of us who was eating with us HAVE been to Pakistan and lived there and this no near any Pakistani food. Second when they said able to cancel the order and turn back to their word is a big irresponsible gesture.Nuttela naan and cheesy naan was not as advised on the videos. Do not be fooled. It was such a big difference.Would say RMSY Best Cheese Naan at least live up to its video advertisement. Their menu for Cheese Naan when asked if Cheese Naan was double cheese then Cheezy naan would be triple cheese? They said its a printing error and we could see the price difference. Price difference but you printed your menu wrongly and we were asking the difference of Cheese Naan and Cheezy Naan since Cheese Naan says Double cheese. Ridiculous! .

The decor was upscale and befitting a diner, and the menu has an array of exciting sounding delicacies that we were not acquainted with (like south american dishes). I picked lamb with fig jam while my wife chose spring chicken with tangy salad. The lamb was tender and cooked just nice so appear medium rare, and sliced and stacked between a loaf of baguette; the fig jam came in a separate porcelain container. The spring roast chicken sat on a bed of cauliflower and broccoli, with diced potatoes and black pepper sauce. Perhaps my choice of fig jam was rather hasty as i love figs; the sweet sauce did not do justice to the lamb. As for the spring chicken, it was a healthy dish but not too exciting to the taste. Overall, it was ok but for the price, we expected something better. Will return for the other items on the menu with their exotic names; the sole dessert, ice cream burger looked tempting (ice cream scoop in a donut) but no thanks, we have to avoid sweet stuff. Lastly the drinks: my wife had pineapple juice while i ordered hot mocha.

Nice place to hang out. The lady boss is extremely knowledgeable about pork - down to details of how pork from different regions can taste different. E.g. when we ordered the ribs, she explained that Malaysian local pork is firmer. If we like our meat firm. but if we prefer it all soft, then American pork. So we tried the American pork ribs and sure enough it was falling off the bone soft. Lovely.The pulled pork burger was a bit too sweet for me.We also had the mantou thingy - it reminded me of Esquire Kitchen's mantou and stewed pork, except here it is not literally swimming in oil like in Esquire (I happen to prefer my pork to be overflowing with oil, so ...

There is a sign for vegetarian to contact them for something to eat. This is good as there wasn’t any vegetarian dish in the menu. The sandwiches are good. So are the spareribs.

A simple setting with a small menu, and humble service.

We had the “fantastic four” which includes traditional BBQ style rips, curry ribs, spicy ribs, and salted egg ribs… all were good – for me the salted egg is the winner, with the curry a close second. The mashed potatoes missed the mark, I will try the lard rice or fries next time.

The decoration, the flashy lights, everything seemed to look good. So we decided to try it, it's pork after all.Everything about the food and drink turned out to be TERRIBLE. The passionfruit juice was literally just syrup (so sweet, and I have a sweet tooth), the pulled pork sandwich was absolutely full of bones I struggled to eat it due to having to rummage around my mouth for bones - taste was not good either. I passED the other half of the sandwich to my friend and a big piece of sharp bone fell on the plate, it sounded like a stone dropping on it. We were done by this point. Then the total came to 68rm - for a sandwich, some chips and essentially a syrup drink.The service was good and the staff were friendly, but I will not be returning here.

"FoodEnthusedKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Didn't enjoy the meal,"Walking into the outlet, you would be drawn to the hip and creative interior and deco that is very pig-centric! The menu is also very porky in range and not for everyone. The outlet came across as very ambitious with elements of commercialism and branding much like Naughty Nuri's. But that's where the similarities end. The menu is big and confusing. If you took time to actually go through it, you will realise that they are merely repetition of the same porky items with different carb choices. While the server was helpful, there was a lot of flipping around the pages before we finally decided what to order. We had the pulled pork pasta and the signature BBQ pork ribs. The latter tasted strongly of gula melaka, which was salty sweet without being too cloying. We liked that it wasn't exactly fall off the bone as other establishments, and had a solid bite to it. The pasta was a big disappointment as the pulled pork, starchy and too sweet, was clumsily slopped over soggy, tasteless over-cooked pasta. It reminded us of eating in British university hall food!

And i decided to try it again, in hope to find some improvement from my last disaster lunch hereFood: 6/10Flavours have definitely improved from the visit, however a few HARD bones were still within our meal, which stated it had their bones removed. One of the hard bones located was at least 3cm in length, which can be quite dangerous. Presentation wise, could be better, but still quite decent in its own ways. However. Food is a tad bit on the pricey side, as my meal cost RM24 for bread, no bone spare rib and a drink.Service: 8/10One of the waiter, Mr Mervin,has to be the best server there today. Quick to help and serve with a smile. However, there was a small little error during ordering, which lead to the junior waitress in entering the wrong order. However, Mr Mervin was quick to step in and clarify the issue. The junior staff should be trained a little bit more to ensure these mistakes dont happen, but besides that, quite good service.Ambience: 6/10The place has quite a unique ambience. Hard to find around these place. However, the biggest issues are the glare coming in from reflection from the cars. They should install some shades to block the glare.In general.

"enochhoAdelaide, Australia",Some interesting and tasty menu items,"Ticklish is a casual place that puts you right at ease. They've got a limited menu that pretty much has pork, pork, and more pork. The ribs are good with a sweetish glaze, half an order gets you three ribs with a full order getting you six. The rest of the menu basically is pork cooked in different styles (try the meatballs! They're amazing!) with your choice of rice, spaghetti or bread. For a more decadent experience, add fried pork lard to your rice/spaghetti! However, I would recommend against adding cheese as you would have to pay a few ringgit extra for them to simply slap a slice of cheese on top of the rice/spaghetti - not very presentable or tasty as you don't get enough cheese covering anything. The sloppy fries are a pretty good addition to the meal, and the sloppy garlic is simply divine (if you're not a vampire, that is), and free refills on the drinks is a nice touch.Show less",4,Reviewed 15 November 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

"joistoriReykjavik, Iceland",Average at most,"Went there with a group of friends and colleagues on the advice of TripAdvisor and this is one of the places you cannot trust it's ""opinion"". TRW is definitely not the best restaurant in Petaling Jaja, as currently rated. This is a BBQ joint and nice as such, food is tasty but nothing super spectacular. You will find this type and quality of food in thousands of other places so no need to make the trip here if you have one closer to your home.Pork is the thing here and you will get it in various versions. I tried the signature ribs, a full bucket of the spicier version, and also the pulled leg sandwich. The sandwich was just ok, relatively neutral in taste and as such a harmless filling to your stomach. The full bucket of the signature spicy ribs were a bigger disappointment, as only one third of them were actual ribs. The rest were end-pieces, mostly bone and very little meat. This part they should definitely not serve as ribs. Accompanying this I got the sloppy garlic and I do not recommend it as a side dish. I just don't get the dish, big bowl of garlic blended in sauce and cheese (I think)... looks to me as something for people who just want to fill their stomach with something.

juz_do_itKuala Lumpur,Expensive and nothing out of the ordinary ribs,"Why are BBQ pork ribs in Klang Valley sooooo expensive? Pork is a lot cheaper than beef in Malaysia yet the eat pork dishes at restaurants can set you back a serioooous bit. K, first thing, the place is creatively decorated. From the front entrance, as you walk in, there are a few great artistic work here that'll make you smile and even chuckle. On all the walls there are quirky murals that'll get you tickled for sure. As for the food, specifically the ribs, they didn't tickle us. When you think of BBQ ribs, I bet you're picturing a slab of succulent, tenderest, meatiest pork ribs, slathered with sweet hickory sauce right ? Yup, that's my idea of a rack of baby pork ribs along with sides of a salad and roasted potato.It's not like that here. The ribs are short and small portioned, served in a tin canister. As if that's not bad enough, they're are reeeeally thin on the meat too. You could say, ""where's the meat?"" Trust me, you won't get that satisfying bite into those pork ribs. Taste wise, they are just OK, definitely, nothing spectacular. Everything is served on waxed paper. You have to add on the sides. My pasta noodles came PLAIN...just salted. No spices...nothing. That was RM5. You want want minced pork over the noodles, it's extra charge.In the end, if you added up the sides and drinks plus the small sized mains, your bill will be hefty. If you like to pay for ambience and cute decor, this is one of the more interesting places I've seen. For the world of me, I don't know why this restaurant is packed with so many youngsters.....clearly, youngsters who can really spend. I really wish the owner had swooned us with the food, rather than invest so much on making the restaurant such a hip joint.Click on Images when you google Ticklish Ribs Seapark - the menu, those teeny, tiny ribs in the canisters, photos of the restaurant are all there.Show less",3,Reviewed 16 August 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

DatoLourdesC,Ribbing it in.,This is one of the best ribs I have tasted in the country. It's tender and succulent and comes complete with its special sauce making it very special. The chips too are something you would crave for after eating it once. The ambience is just simple with all kinds of porky talks and design befitting a pork ribs restaurant. Free flow of soft drinks the extras like pork rice gives those patrons something extra to chew on.

Simon Y,"Go for the Ribs, not the Environment","As I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted by a lovely waitress who then brought my friend and I through a rough introduction of their menu.Despite the friendly customer service, I had a hard time placing my order. Instead of taking my order and processing it right away, I had to queue up at the counter to pay.I'm not saying that this is an abnormal practice in modern day cafés nowadays, but seeing as there's already not much space for walking around, I don't think having your customers take up space standing in line to pay is a good idea. I lined up, only to find that that's not the designated queue up line. To make matters worse, I had to wait doubly long since the cashier prioritized other patrons and let them pay before me. Just as I thought it's not going to be a good day, the ribs turned it around. It was awesome as recommended. The meat falls off the bones nicely, and the marinade is really tasty.My friend and I ordered pulled pork with rice, chewbwakka with wholemeal bread and some cheesy fries as well, but unfortunately, I would only return for the ribs.Show less",3,Reviewed 24 July 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

If it's bad but edible then I'd rate it poor. But when the majority of the food is so disappointing, I can't help but give it the lowest rating possible.Order a serving each of their ribs - spicy and non-spicy. Non-spicy came dry and some part burnt. Really pathetic cuts of meat and really small portion. Spicy was a lot better, tender, juicy and a much better cut. And they really do mean spicy. Ordered the fried pork with bun. FML, even a sandwich at Subway could be considered 10 times better than what we got. Pathetic thin slice of something (I could not identify it as meat) with some onions, green pepper and lettuce. Honestly we left this place wanting to wash it down with a Ramly burger. It was horribly bland. And the add-on salad? More onions, green pepper and lettuce in a tiny bowl. Can't believe I paid RM10 for this.

I saw this place last year with my family and finally got the chance to try it this month. We had other places in mind, but since this was the only interesting place open during that time, we went for it. So here it goes.. Interior is fun and playful. You could tell from the moment you enter the door that this place is for people who drink (alcohol) and eat at the same time. I met the manager and she was helpful and entertaining. She explained the menu to us and that made it easier for us to order. I asked what are the best sellers. She immediately recommended their signature ribs. We also ordered Hoilam Ting with Rice and Got Balls with Pasta. We received the Hoilam Ting first, followed by the ribs. I waited for more than 20 minutes for my meal, to find out that she forgot about it. After 5-8mins, my food arrived. Here are my feedback about the food: Okay, signature ribs. That's their signature ribs, it was okay. What a rib should be. It was more sweet than BBQ to me. But hey, that's their signature recipe. I'm fine with it. What I don't like though, for 3 pieces it's RM22! Next, the Hoilam Ting. It's my first time to try something like that. It was like eating pork and beans. It was too sweet and daaaamn, the rice! The rice was too dry! You know it's not good quality. Lastly, the GOT Balls. Few pieces of balls and too much pasta! I didn't even like the pasta. I was so disappointed. For me, personally, if I have a restaurant that fun-looking, I'm going to make sure that every single thing that comes out of that kitchen is good quality. The noodles were made for soup. Shame.. The got balls won't be appreciated because of the cheap pasta. If ever I come back, I'm going to try the sandwich. Definitely going to try that! Wait for it guys!

If you are expecting crispy fries to be served, you will be amazed with the opposite! If you think only baby back ribs can offer the tenderness, you will be convinced otherwise in Ticklish!It was my family's first visit and we ordered the signature BBQ ribs (The Ultimate Tickle), sloppy fries topped with minced pork, pork sandwich with charcoal bread, salad (zzzalad) and drinks. When I bit the ribs, I was surprised that the meat was marinated with Asian spice which had no hint of BBQ sauce flavor which I was accustomed from other Western style rib shops. Result? I, my wife and 2 children loved it!! And the meat was very tender even though the rib bone were big. The pork sandwich tasted very similar to Chinese's ""Dongpo"" Pork 東坡肉 (dōng pō ròu) style plus mixed raw onion and green vegetables - a fusion sandwich which I ordered another one after the first was snatched up fast! Sloppy Fries was actually a topping of Chinese spice marinated minced meat over the crispy fries which made it soggy but appetizing! It was a paradigm shift with the way one eats fries. Again, I repeated my order as it was real good! Salad was nothing special and no point ordering unless you needed some green to go along with meaty food.

"bentong66Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Good food, good fun","Lovely, casual cafe-style, with fun decor, and lovely food.Ribs are great -- especially the spicy version, which you don't get in many places. The regular ribs, served in a little pail, are great for kids. Fries are crispy and really tasty, and the whole atmosphere is one of good food, relaxed and fun.

"Winston LPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Rather average joint,"Went there in December 2015 after learning of its good rating on Trip Advisor. Ordered the Lazy Bone pasta and roast pork.

"DanielJLaiPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Unimpressive Restaurant.,"So. I decided to try out this ""so called #1 restaurant in Petaling Jaya"" since i was around the block. So we ordered a Lazy Bones with Pasta and a Lazy Bones with Charcoal Bun. ""LAZY BONES"" is apparently pork ribs with their bones taken out. So when we got our meals, it looks quite appetising, i must add, but when we were eating, we discovered 1 PIECE OF HARD BONE (attached with the pics), and 4 soft bones. So much for being de-boned,huh.. We also order roast pork (siew yuk in Cantonese). It was not bad, however it was a bit overdone and in some part of it burnt. We also had bottomless drinks included, and sadly, we found ants in our Sprite. Now, that was a bad way to end this meal... And all this cost a total of RM78 for two people. Which is very expensive for the food we have gotten. Sadly, i wouldnt recommended this place to anyone at all at the current moment. Lets just hope this was one of their off-days...

"CrystalismKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Your average ribs place....,"Do not like ribs that did not come in one piece. Them cutting it into pieces for us already killed the ribs experience. Also, RM38 for 6 miserable pieces is not worth the money at all. Also because I felt the ribs is not flavourful enough. Meat falls off from bone without issues, but there was no ""wow factor"". Not sure how it's being cooked but it's not chargrilled enough. Soft on the inside, and also the outside, no chargrilled flavours on the outer layer.Staffs are however very, very, friendly. Still, there's no reason to visit again to spend that much money just to savour on mediocre quality food. Not sure about the sandwich, could give it a try if I actually go back again.Show less",3,Reviewed 5 January 2016 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

The staffs were all so hospitable, one of them, I guess she is the owner, she even gave us a short overview on their menu and also some recommendations. I would give a thumb's up for the services they provided!Anyway, I found it is a cute and fun place to dine in, because of its crazy yet cute interior design, wherein you could see all the little evil piglets everywhere, the whole place is just so PIGGY!About the food, it tasted good but not some sort of extraordinary tastes, a bit overpriced in my personal view.

I have long been a ""meatasaurus"" like my father before me - and pork and beef ribs stands tall on top my fave pieces of meat to date. So, when Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches opened their doors in good ol PJ, it was a definite must visit and eat-in place. Well, at least for the not so faint-hearted porkaholics that is!!!I can't tell you the last time I had good old fashion, classic home-styled, smokey-sticky-to-the-bone-yummylicious ribs, but I sure can tell you that this joint makes flavorful meat to the core! The owners sure went through a lot of trouble perfecting only on the taste, but the flavors and the texture too. Even my picky son loved their ribs, and insisted that he gets one while bucket to himself. The meat is succelant and tender, falls easily off the bone and the spices used - yums is the word!!!!The restaurant is cosy and definitely a place for friends to meat, eat and chat, or families to spend a day piggin' out. The bottomless soft drinks is a good pull (as long as no one takes advantage that is!!). Most Friday (or weekend) may see a queue, as Ticklish is a launchpad for musicians and comedians to perform past 10pm til late - but hey, I'd Q-4-BBQ Ribs anyday - as long as their out-of-this-world good!!!Great service and great classic styled porkaholic-loved food - can't go wrong with that.

Kenneth K,Creative and good food,Am a pork-rib lover and have tried many ribs places all over the Klang Valley. Visited this place in November after seeing their adverts on Facebook. Pleasantly surprised to find their creativeness in blending local flavors into their recipe. The pork ribs have their own unique taste which is different from the BBQ ribs served at Western Diners. The pasta and rice dishes are good too. Owners came and check on us to get our feedback and very friendly. Only thing is that portion is a tad small and big eaters might need to order 2 servings. Suggest they upsize the servings somewhat as I feel diners won't mind paying slightly more for a fulfilling meal.Show less,4,Reviewed 3 December 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

In general, I prefer savoury for food and sweet for dessert. But having said that, theirs was less sweet than I expected.Service was excellent - 5 stars friendly, patient (they took time to check if I was a first timer, explained their system and the menu and basically helped me navigate the menu and come up with my order).If you like BBQ sauce type ribs, you'd like this place. It's not as sweet as some of the other joints (TGIF comes to mind).They have a lot of signs in the restaurant which can have you giggling and laughing if you take the time to read them.

"Andreas JRio de Janeiro, RJ",Very promising (chef review),"As a German/American Chef living in Malaysia I had to check out this highly rates pork BBQ place. The menu is well intended and they stick with their humor that works well. It does require a bit of culinary knowledge to understand what meat type you are ordering (ribs, pork belly, pulled pork, pork loin, pork thigh). I like how the design and execution is well thought through. From the door sign warning Non halal people to the piggies on the wall this is a fun joint. The portion are small by western sizes but then the prices are descent. BBQ takes time and this is hand made and not subway frozen stuff. Pork ribs:Fantastic spiced marinade. The do fall of the bone with is what many like. I personally like a bit of chew but that's preference. They use a combi oven to give them nice crisp charring. The spice is at first a bit overpowering but their Asian BBQ sauce with nice ginger is helping that. The non spicy version is definitely missing something. Pork belly:This was my least favorite. It's braised but dry in the meat and the fat did not render as the heat was too low. Finishing it over a hot grill would do wonders to it. The marinade is tasty. Blackened porn loin:Very tasty, soy ginger Lemongrass marinade. It goes under in a sandwich and is best served over the fantastic pork lard ginger rice!Marinated pork thigh:This was my favorite. Yummy, fresh and good on sandwiches. Very well done fusion. The sloppy fries are nearly a poutine and quite nice. The pasta is a bit bland but as TC(owner) mentioned in another review here it's hard to please everybody. Some like soft some like al dente but don't come here for pasta so get the awesome rice instead!The staff is super friendly and the manager took a good10minutes of her time to chat with me about the food and listened to my critique. I had driven up from JB and was eager to see if the rave reviews hold up. And I feel they do. Are they fake? I doubt it. The staff is asking folks to write these and I don't think people say yes and then don't do it. I'm unbiased and clearly state what I loved and what I did not care for. I'd hope TC is reading this and reaching out as if love to know about the crowdfunding to get a pork BBQ heaven in JB soon :)Thank you for the piggy!Andreas JablonkaChef & Post Production GuyShow less",4,Reviewed 22 November 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

At first glance the menu looks complicated but the servers are on hand to give you a run thru on how it works!We ordered a bucket of The Spicy and The Not So Much ribs to share for 4 ladies. The unanimous agreement was that the Spicy version was more tasty. Love the flavours and how the meat just fell off the bones!The next thing that blew our tastebuds away was the sloppy fries! We love this so so much! It was like a party in the mouth! Couldn't stop reaching for more. I'd happily eat this all day!! I would highly recommend the from Kuchikoo (side dishes) a basket of deep fried garlic too. So yummy and feels quiet healthy too haha.We ordered some version of porky with pasta and the charcoal bread but it wasn't my kinda thing.

"Lin LSan Francisco, California",In the mood for Ribs? This is the only place to go!!,"So, I'm back on holiday from the States where I've been living for almost 20 years now. And I always go for the local fare. But my girl was in the mood for ribs - born in America, what - so we headed to this new place. First off - it's not big. I'm guesstimating 30-40 seats? But that's how I like my dining experience so that's a plus. And the decor is amazing! The walls are mural-ed and you'll never mistake it for a vegetarian restaurant. Cute pigs everywhere.You walk up to the counter to order. The menu - super imaginative! Dishes like ChewBakKwa (sandwich made with bak kwa. See what they did there?) and You Braise Me Up (so I can savor the yummy slow cooked streaky pork). Even the drinks, aka lubricants, come in 'Going soft' or 'Like it harder'. On that note, to be clear - the restaurant is very family friendly. My daughter is 16 and found the menu giggle worthy and quite clever. It'll go over the heads of younger ones. Who will love the decorations on the walls. And the unique service slide. I've never seen this anywhere else. Food is cooked in the back kitchen and when ready, sent in trays down a slide, where it gets picked up by the servers and brought to your table. Fantastic idea - keeps the need for servers walking through the space to a minimum and is an eye-catching feature.Preamble aside...crux of any restaurant review...how was the food? 1 word - Yummylicious! 2 words - Must return. In fact, we ate there twice more in the two weeks we were back. The recipe for the ribs is a closely guarded secret and made off-site by only 2-3 people. The sauce is to die for and seriously finger-licking good. We'll definitely be back again. In addition, I really liked that the management is giving back to the community - they had, very unobtrusively, some mugs for sale - made by youths with learning disabilities with all sales proceeds going to that foundation. The mugs weren't in your face at all and the servers don't push them but my goodness - they are adorable. Slightly larger than espresso size, with snouts at the bottoms.Bottom line - we had a wonderful dining experience here. Ambiance and food were excellent and we look forward to returning.Show less",5,Reviewed 29 August 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

The pork ribs had a drop-off-the-bone quality to it, and was flavourfully marinated, while the battered pork struck the right balance of being crispy but not too dry. The service was top-notch, and we suspect that the friendly, humble man who attended to us was the owner himself. My parents, who are from Penang, invited him to start an outlet there so that they don't have to come all the way to Petaling Jaya to enjoy the ribs at Ticklish. Prices were also very reasonable, compared to other franchises specialising in the same kind of cuisine.Show less",5,Reviewed 22 August 2015 ,Ticklish Ribs & 'Wiches

Instead we had the soft rib sandwich, soft ribs on pasta and 'Once you go black', a lean piece of meat on the pasta. Firstly, never ever order the pasta. It was TERRIBLE and tasted like it came out of a can. It was overdone and too soft. It didn't look appetizing as well. Out of our 3 orders, the soft rib sandwich was most edible but still nothing compared to some other places for the price you are paying.

"Leeroy888Sydney, Australia",Good Ribs Not Excellent,"Read and heard so many good reviews on Trip Advisor and Face Book, we finally visited Ticklish Ribs at 5:45 pm on 15 July 2015. We managed to get a table for 2, and were given temporary menu (menu is being printed). We ordered 2 buckets of ribs, one original (6 ribs RM38), and spicy (6 ribs RM38), and a bucket of Tiger beer (RM 38 x 5 bottles – happy hr price normal RM58). I was slight disappointed with the ribs as they were good, not excellent with my high expectation. Tony Roma and TGI Friday ribs are much better but the price is double. Considering 30 spices used, the ribs were good, tasty and fall off the bone, my rating is 7.5/10. Total cost was RM114 (AUD$40). Good value.When leaving at 7pm, the restaurant was packed, and there was a huge line up.

The restaurant was still considered new and it seemed that everyone in town wanted to try it out. After all that waiting and receiving half of what I ordered - we had to check with the server to get our remaining order and he took our receipt away, I was disappointed that the ribs were the soggy type and slathered with sauce. I prefer my ribs to be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside rather than having the strong sauce overpower the taste of the ribs.

Junji937,How could you do this to me.,"Hear me out. I came here first time, frustrated from work. It was a friday night. The whole week got to me. I was stressed. Hungry, and angry. I circled Seapark more than 12 times to get a parking space. My friends were waiting for me already inside. The jam was horrid. Nevertheless i was cheesed.Then I came in, 90% of the menu was out. I was angry, hungry and disappointed. So I paid, got myself a bottle of Guinness to numb my pain from the hectic week and waited the next 30min for my food. The numbers called skipped my number. I don't know how the numbers work so i was annoyed that my number was skipped and my friends are already half way to their wiches. Added more points to anger. After another 5minutes I was already raging, hungry, depressed and irritated in all kind of senses you can think of. Then my number rang and i went to get my meatball sandwich and ribs.Skeptic. I told the bread in my hands that 'You better be worth the wait' and tore the wrapping half way through and took a bite.That fried lard. Them balls. Them sauce. Them bread. Them sin. Them pork.THEM RIBS. THEM SAUCE. THEM CRACKLING SPICE. THEM FALLING OFF BONE GOODNESS.HOW DARE YOU serve such good meals. HOW DARE YOU open in a place with insufficient parking spaces. HOW DARE YOU run out of porky goodness at almost end of the day. HOW DARE YOU.I take everything back.It was so good. My mood instantly lifted. It was SO GOOD; the wait, the rage, the frustration seemed like a nose booger that was never a problem residing in your deepest darkest nasal canals. The sandwich was so good, it was SO SO GOOD. I take every single negativity i had back. I take everything back. This place serves porky sinful pleasure so good that I wish heart attack was a myth. This place is so good I wish calories were an urban myth.Ticklish, The owners, the team, the brains behind this place. How could you do this to me? This place is so good I'm not sure if i should be crying or should I be happy.I will be coming back. That's definitely for sure. Next time, your 8 minute challenge.

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",HOMST did not deliver,"Homst Chinese Muslim restaurant boasts of chinese cooking but at our latest visit, we barely detected the chinese in the food we ordered.Malaysian yes but chinese?Let's start with radish cake. Traditionally fried like char kway teow, this one came in chilied cubes on a bed of beansprouts. Nothing like the one you get in a genuine chinese restaurant like Dodo for example.Next is the sizzling taufu: when served the sizzle had gone and we beheld a large pan of spicy sauce where egg and taufu were swimming in. The taufu was sparsely spread, giving the impression there was not enough to go around in a crowded restaurant.But it was the taste that made us conclude that this is more a Malaysian than chinese restaurant. Chinese cooking is distinguished by the freshness; food here looked lethargic as if the kitchen was not enthusiastic enough or perhaps the chinese chef is taking a break.And we passed up on dim sum deciding it would be better to wait for an occasion to celebrate at Chynna where one finds the best dim sum in town.One can get a decent Malaysian meal here but we wish the chinese style is not too compromised to cater to those who are not too particular.

"Long MKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Try others...,"Whenever one mentions Hulu Yam, the first dish that comes into mind is Loh Mee, which is a starchy with egg braised thick noodles. However, restaurants here are not of hotel and/or big restaurants with great presentation. Restaurants here are really for the food.Obviously, Loh Mee was the main dish to try. Other dishes ordered were braised pork leg in claypot, stir fried vegetable, fried soya noodles, and ginger fried with fish cutlets.The Loh Mee is good, but may not be the best. The reason is every eatery in Hulu Yam seems to be doing the same thing. So, taste is depends on individual and subjective.As for fried soya noodles, it is good, but soya noodles does not absorb gravy well, hence it is dry. Maybe should have ordered the same but using vermicelli instead.Fish cutlet fried with ginger is really good and well done, and the braised pork leg in claypot is just okay.Overall is okay, as in palatable. Price wise it is reasonable as it is located in somewhat an outback area.The restaurant also sells biscuits and other tidbits which is displayed along the walls.They do have homemade soya bean milk, which is okay, but a little watery though.Show less",4,Reviewed 1 June 2015 ,Swee Yen Restaurant

"Homing_Pigeon1Cuneo, Italy","No frills, just taste","A business lunch brings me to this place. Seems just another Chinese restaurant, wide, with round tables and red tablecloths, lazy susans and so on. Two persons, we don’t eat too much but what comes to the table does not go back unless the plate is empty. Some good dim-sum, as you can find in many other places. The highlight is the fried rice. Such a common plate, tried thousands of times, every time a bit different. Here, for some reason that I even find hard to explain, is one of the best I ever tried. Tasty but not too salty, well fried and not oily, a balanced mix of rice and other ingredients, the scent is telling you already eat me. Period. I like drinking Pu Er tea when I have lunch and I expect something a bit fatty. Nothing really fatty there, nevertheless the Pu Er is good and the pinch of tea leaves enough to make a perfect infusion, not too weak, not to strong. Just right. Can pay with credit cards.

"ST LWollongong, Australia",Delicious Appam,"Came here with a friend who recommended this place. The appam is fantastic! Crispy on the outside with santan in the middle. We loved it so much we ordered another one to share, and a third to take away. We also ordered a plain roti canai, that’s nice too but the dhal is a bit different, probably their own version. We had different waiters at various times take our order (because we kept adding more food!) and they were all friendly. We walked to the counter to pay and were surprised that the counter lady didn’t have a list of what we ordered, and so we told the lady what we had. It seems like an honesty system. A recent reviewer commented that the appam is expensive at RM4 each. Not sure how this person got charged this price but it’s certainly not RM4. Our meal today consisted of 3 appams, 1 plain roti canai, 1 hot teh tarik, 1 hot kopi-o, 1 cold kopi-o, and 1 Indian donut, total of RM13.40.

"haneeakadirSubang Jaya, Malaysia",Dissapointing Food,"Went there yesterday night and ordered their salmon and beef burger which was amongst their recommended items on their menu. I had a whole imagination in my mind of how exciting my plate would looked like with the text description on the menu. But alas, this was one of the time where I felt the most letdown with the food served. I took the salmon with grilled tiger prawn served on mashed potato and vege with creamy lobster sauce. Now tell me if it doesnt excite your palate. What I got was not fresh grilled prawn and not properly cleaned, very bad mashed potato with no taste to any flavor. The star was supposed to be the salmon which was chargrilled but served in together with wet stir fried vege which took out the crispiness of the salmon skin. Then to top it off, there was way too much tomato in the creamy lobster sauce which was not creamy at all that totally killed any taste of the salmon. And to top it off, they served all these in a pasta plate rather than a flat one which left no room for one to enjoy each bit of the meal without mushing them in the mashed potato. The beef burger was the unexpected letdown. First off, it did not taste of fresh patties for the price that they are charging. Then, the fries were not even cooked properly. Who can screw up frying fries?In short, great place, great ambience, great service but seriously, please change your chef. Show less",1,Reviewed 24 April 2017 ,Twenty & Co

No gst and service charge haha). However, waiting time may be long. We reached here at 6.30pm and waited for our food for about 30 min (6 tables before us). Seats were limited too. Honestly to my personal taste, I find that the food was tasted very heavily. I would prefer food that has a ""clean"" taste but according to my father, he said that the typical Hakka food tasted heavily in this way because they lived in highlands and salty food can be preserved longer.

I walked in and followed the usual covid-19 protocols. I ordered the ayam-goreng berempah, with the additional pineapple sambal with an iced tea, kurang manis. I paid upfront rm27.90 I think and found my table. The iced tea arrived in a wonderful copper mug allowing it to be kept cold for a longer period. Unfortunately the tea was terrible. It was unbelievably light that one could hardly taste the tea. And of course it was too sweet!!!!I took it back and told them the problem and requested that they add more black tea to it. My nasi lemak arrived a bit later, but without the pineapple sambal. The usual sambal was there, in an extremely small jar. Certainly insufficient for a plate of nasi lemak. But I preferred to wait for the former. And waited. And waited some more. I walked up to the counter and enquired of it and the reply was that 'she' was making it. On closer inspection I noticed that 'she' was prepping other plates of food. I asked her when would the pineapple sambal be ready?? She wasnt happy with the question and walked away in a huff.Oh! Well. I walked back and began to tuck in. The chicken was disappointing. It was more KFC styled, albeit darker but without the supposed 'rempah'. I think a proper marinade would be in order. Much of the chicken was left unfinished. No complaints about the ikan bilis, nuts, cucumber and the egg. The pineapple sambal finally arrived. Similarly to the chicken, pieces of pineapple are added to a random sambal. Without pineapple pulp or pineapple juice added to the sambal. So it isn't truly a pineapple sambal. Adding apple chunks to sambal would not similarly make it an apple sambal. I think you can see where I'm going with this.So overall it was a disappointing visit.

isodavies,Didn’t meet expectations...,"My partner and I were so excited to visit as we were craving Mexican food for a long time now! We saw the reviews and believed it would be great food. The menu is okay, they only list 1 meal as vegetarian (quesadillas) even though every mexican dish (fajita, burrito, enchilada, quesadillas etc) can be made vegetarian ... it’s very simple. Anyway, I was expecting it to be great considering it was the only option for me.My quesadillas arrived and were sooo thin, there was nothing inside except diced onion and cheese. Surely you can make it more exciting than that? Mushrooms? Roasted vegetables? Anything!? They state on their menu that each main dish comes with rice and beans, but we literally had a tablespoon of rice with 2 beans mixed in. It also states guacamole and sour cream but we only got a small blob of each. This was so so so disappointing. For RM30+ I felt cheated to receive this to be honest. My boyfriend enjoyed his fajitas, but was also shocked by the tiny portion of rice and beans that was promised.The wine was nice and the staff were very friendly and provided really good service. For me this was the only positive. I don’t mind to spend money on an expensive dinner if the food delivers, but I left feeling dissatisfied and still hungry.Show less",3,Reviewed 17 July 2019 ,Las Carretas Restaurant & Bar

Ordered the lamb chop which was a set lunch menu : pricy at RM33.50. The dish came with a side of wilted salad with small tomatoes. The sauce was not inspiring ( a black sourish and salty sauce served with the very thin lamb slices with bone attached on a grill. The lamb was not aromatic as no seasoning or marinade was put on it before grilling and so it did not live up to its mexican roots. I was expecting that at least they would marinade the meat before putting on the grill but i suppose that would messs up the grill. i asked for mint sauce and they gave me a teaspoon of it.. That saved the dish. In fact i would recommend that they swerve the lamb with mint sauce in future.

The interior was a little kitschy but it felt cozy and inviting, with sufficient Mexican accents to keep it in theme. Charming!If I had to sum up the meal, it was hearty and tasty. The ingredients may not be as refined and authentic as La Mexicana but at a price range with most dishes well under RM30, it's more than decent.The mussels were a great start; the thick, creamy broth with fresh cilantro and habanero doubled equally good as a soup. I liked the thoughtfulness of the folded tortillas; perfect for soaking up the bowl of deliciousness. If they had been toasted slightly, even better.The seared marks on the charbroiled sole was a good indication of the rustic smokey flavours that followed. The fish retained its succulence and the flavours were light, yet rich. I am still contemplating if the baked potato was really necessary.Chili con corne was next, it was hard to resist checking out this classic Tex-Mex dish. It passed with flying colours. Old school yumminess. Love the fluffiness of the rice and the meaty chilli stew was lip-smacking. A personal preference - a bit more heat would have been perfect.Overall, the food is good enough to warrant a repeat visit.

Having visited this restaurant after reading online reviews we were very disappointed. We wanted a lamb seekh kebab starter but it wasn't available, then decided to order chapal kebab, that wasn't available either so in the end we had chicken and fish tikkas, lamb karahi, channa masala and naan bread. The starters were not very well flavoured, the lamb karahi consisted of long thin pieces of fatty meat and was ok tasting but no where near as good as authentic karahis. The chana masala was bland and we were struggling to eat it. The naans are small to begin with and are then quartered before serving! No sauces are served with the starters, the first Pakistani/Indian restaurant we have ever been to where this has been the case.We visited as a family and none of us enjoyed the food, this is not Pakistani food and definitely not good quality food however is charged at a premium price tag.Show less",2,Reviewed 9 April 2017 ,Sheesh Mahal

Some history lesson, I used to study in INTI College from 1997-1998 so I'm quite well-versed in Subang area but I have never ever gone opposite side to SS14 before. That day I had, for the first time in my life, what they called fried asam laksa. Technically it is asam laksa without the broth and they fried the lai fun with asam laksa sauce. After a while (I seldom go to Subang area) the opportunity came one day when my parents happened to be in Subang and I thought them here. ◾Deep fried fish skin - something to munch on while waiting for the other dishes. ◾nasi lemak with curry chicken - I quite like their curry chicken gravy as it was similar to what I always eat growing up. ◾laksa with curry chicken - now when they add the same curry chicken together with the curry gravy into the laksa, it somehow made the difference and I found it quite tasty. The quintessential cockles were present so everything's good. ◾fried asam laksa - simply put it, I love this dish.. you'd find most of the flavour and asam laksa ingredients in this plate plus prawns & bean sprout akin to char kuey teow. I simply squeezed the lime juice and mixed everything together before slurping away. The price is kept relatively affordable because this is a student area after all and the market is too big to be ignored.

Unfortunately, the lobster meat was slightly mushy but had a beautiful layer of melted cheese on top with a pinch of chilli flakes giving the dish a very slight spicy edge. This was finished with a downpour of aromatic herbs.Recommended?

The base of the cake was rich and creamy with a slice of juicy watermelon. Each layer had a very smooth texture to it. Although the top had chopped strawberries, lychee and grapes, the cake was not overpoweringly sweet. It was very refreshing and a great way to end the mealRecommended?

We have ordered and additional cake called Rose Lychee Almond crumble as the watermelon cake was too little for us (i guess you can make the portion bigger than that..its way too small).. Hmm this cake was rather too sweet for me, so for those who does not really like sweet stuff you may wanna skip this one. but again watermelon cake is definitely a good to go!! One thing which kinda pissed me off is the attitude of some staff. Not all.. but just some of them..other were friendly and being very helpful in serving us. I didn't get his name but he was super rude.. no smile on his face and whatever we said to him including thank you was not even replied. Being in a food service industry i think this is pretty important to give your guest a big smile (i mean a sincere one) so that they will return to you. Honestly if it was not for the watermelon cake that i will return for this will for sure be my last visit. I hope Naj & Belle Subang could take note on this. I don't like to complain but if i do it means it has over my limit. Thank you...Show less",3,Reviewed 20 November 2017 ,Naj & Belle

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Pretty good pavlova,My sweet tooth takes me far and wide and this time to Naj Belle. They call it deconstructed pavlova. I think it is impt to note that the pavlova itself is good. Many other kitchens use too much cream and that really bloats you up. Secondly some others tend to use grapes (it is cheaper i suppose) but the juice from the fruit tend to seep and destroy the sugar. At Naj this does not happen as there are no grapes. Just strawberries. Some raspberries would be nice though. And theres just the right amount of cream. So it is much better than the one at Serai. I should point out that they may be a tad misguided on the term 'deconstructed' as what they have done is merely taken the entire cake apart and served it deconstructed! If you're looking at it from a construction point of view its fine but it is not true to form. Of course i could be nitpicking! Show less,4,Reviewed 20 May 2017 ,Naj & Belle

Attended their wine matching dinner event recently, whereby chef Shiomi-san, matches the food with the wines pretty harmoniously. However, was a little disappointed this time because the wagyu A3 was over-cooked thus became really tough - didn't finish the wagyu dine. Shiomi-San is a talented cook and believe this minor slip-up was because of the group dining with 22 pax. As he is the only cook and he single-handedly cooked the whole dinner, hence overwhelmed with the task, which resulted in the mistake. The management has to take note and rectify the situation by hiring a sous-chef to support him.

The service was prompt as there was someone that greeted us a the door and quickly got us a seat. The crowd was a mix of family and young working adults.We ordered the chawanmushi and the the one with crab meat and sharks fin as well. The regular chawanmushi was really bad as the eggs felt overcooked and hard. The crab meat one tastes much better with more well cooked eggs but it costs RM10 more. The Unagi that we ordered was rubbery and not well grilled. Slightly below average as I was expecting more , as it costs RM50. Rakuzen definitely wins in the area. The rice was hard and unappetising, topped with not so savoury gravy as well.The fish skin was nice on the first bite and not after, maybe it's the oil that feels that it has been reused and not fresh. Thee tempuras here are slightly flacid and the yasai tempura is over cooked and slightly charred but it's a full Nepalese team that's cooking it, not Japanese or locals so you can expect much for quality. The salmon sashimi I would say is good value for money as you get 7 slices for RM25, which is very decent however, 3 belly slices and 4 slices of God knows which part of the fish. At least they provide freshly grated wasabi so that was good. The overall experience was ok, as service was prompt and would definitely be good as a family type of Restaurant.

"Matthew NPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Steady and Sturdy... Classic Western Food,"As I understand it from the waiters of this restaurants, this place has been around for 15 years. This branch that is. There are several Windmill Restaurants out there but this is not to be confused with The Windmill Station (TWS).If I am not mistaken this is the same branch as the one in Subang. And this is supposedly a spin-off from the famous classic restaurants known as The Ship.The standard of service here has been consistent over the 10 years that I have been dining here. Usually for lunch, as my office is nearby, I have tasted most of their dishes including their set lunch which is popular among the local office workers around the Bandar Baru Klang area.As of this review, there are now Thai Dishes set lunch. Yes, a little surprising for a western cuisine but I guess one has to be innovative in this day and age. The Thai dishes are acceptable, nothing like the real thing of course, but for the price they set, it's otherwise satisfactory.I usually come here for the mixed grill, steak, lamb chop, chicken chop, beef bacon, chicken sausage with fried egg and french fries. The sauce is actually quite nice, though I suppose for a meal under RM50/- (Which comes with a side of soup of the day usually cream of mushroom, ice lemon tea and ice cream for dessert), one can't expect too much of the beef. (For better steaks you can try their chef's recommended grilled sirlion steak or rib eye, usually a much better cut of steak.The ambience is actually quite relaxing.

On its website, it promises to ""deliver only the most unadulterated tastes, the most heartwarming, sincere service and a gastronomical experience so enjoyable that it will always hold a place in your heart.""It specialises in Heng Hwa cuisine and presents a rather unusual take on chinese food. Among its signature dishes are Iced Abalone, Iced Bitter Gourd and Drunken Cockles - all of which I plan to savour on my next visit.This time however, Dad wasn't feeling so adventurous so we had the Stir-Fried Chilli Live Clams (super tasty with a good portion of ""kuah"" - gravy), Sweet and Sour Pork (I would have been happier if the morsels of meat retained its deep-fried crunch, but otherwise it was ok), Bian Rou Soup with vinegar (little wanton parcels in a slightly tangy, sour soup - good stuff!) and Fried Heng Hwa Beehoon (description sounded tastier than the dish itself, but the noodles were indeed fine. Perhaps the louder flavours from the other dishes overpowered this choice).The bill came to about RM80 (which included two glasses of warm water and a bowl of steamed white rice - RM2.20).

Riding on the one Michelin Star award, this is one of their outlets, in Subang Jaya, Selangor.Located on thr 1st floor inside SS15 Courtyard, which is very easy to find them. the shop front is really nice and grand looking.. Even when you walk in too feels grand, where the waiters and waitresses will greet in unison.The receiving staff at the front entrance will usher to a table.We were given the pictured and described menu, and were given some time to look through to choose.Immediately, one of the waiter came with the tidbits, 2 types to be exact.The captain came by to take our orders and we ordered, She does upsell and recommend their signature dishes.Ordered their Cabbage soup, Bamboo Herbal Prawn soup, fried Bee hoon, Lor mee, Cabbage rice. As usual, when going to chinese meal, Chinese tea is a must. The captain recommended 2 types to choose, Xiang Pian and Da Hong Pao. We opted for Dao Hong Pao, which is served in per cup per head basis.The tea came per cup per head, where inside the cup is a ceramic strainer for the tea leaves. the waiter who served the tea brought a like a tiny hour glass. That is to time to let the tea to brew, which is not for long, say a couple of minutes. Each cup of tea is served with a smaller cup, which is for us to put the strainer with the leaves. The strainer can be taken out and drink the tea from the main cup itself. Hot water can be refilled.The order is served. Even though it is small portion, but they are really filling.The Bamboo Herbal Prawn soup is served in a bamboo container, which is good for 1 person. This soup is really tasty, which comes with 2 prawns in each serving. We ordered 2 of this soup.The cabbage soup too is really good, which has a few pieces of beancurd and some seafood and meat in it. Their fried bee hoon is really good with seafood like clams. Cabbage rice is nice too. Their Lor Mee is something different. Unlike the usual kind you find in and around KL and maybe Malaysia. It is not starchy like the usual kind and not too watery too. Good enough to eat by itself without adding black vinegar.Taste overall is well balanced.The tea too is really good and lasting after refilling twice with hot water. Usual tea would have lost its taste and colour by then.It is like fine dining. However, the tea is really costly. This is something one have to bear in mind before ordering.

The last two times we dined here, we had to wait for quite a while for our food. Last week when we were there, a party of five of us, all of us had our meals and were done eating, but my husband had to wait for quite a long time for his bento set (sushi and udon). After complaining a few times, they brought the set over with the sushi but without the udon, and said he had to wait for the udon. When he was about to eat his sushi, he noticed a piece of hair on his food, lost his appetite, returned the bento set and refused to eat. The waitress was most apologetic about it, but it wasn't her fault, but the kitchen's. The manager came over and asked ""May I help you?"" which was a strange question because he should have apologised instead of asking such a question. The queue here at this restaurant is long.

I only took 1/3 of it. and it was just so soft. they only had fried chicken at the time as the fish wasn't ready. and that was just ordinary. the gravy was bland and the fried cabbage was too soft.but at rm9.00 we should not complain I guess.Show less,2,Reviewed 14 April 2021 ,Yap Kee Banana Leaf

esdtesq,Very disappointing,"After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a good (not great) local Italian Restaurant. I was not expecting NY, New Jersey or even Boston. The food was awful and the service was worse. It’s clear the owner and the waitresses favor their regulars. I expect to be treated as a guest not an annoyance. Both the owner and waitress were extremely loud making any other conversation impossible. The veal I ordered was so tough, I could not cut it with a knife. Worse the owner responded to my Google review as if I was another person and clearly did not read my review. He indicated I came back for takeout which is ridiculous since the didn’t like the meal., referred to my partner sending back his veal which he did not. If you are going to respond to a review, at least read it. If you want decent Italian food in Tarpon Springs, there are many choices.

Didn’t check review before it was just the closest one. I took linguine pesto and bruschetta. Bruschetta are tasteless, likely due lack of ingredients quality, tomatoes and olive oil are like to be cheap one. The pesto sauce is horrible, I have serious doubt that the Chef know that pesto is made with parmegiano, none trace of a gram of such delicious cheese. I have to order separately some and they bring me literally 2 tea spoon. The Olive oil used is likely the cheapest one as well as tasteless, and still wondering what make the pesto green cause i didn’t taste at all the basil. So all in all if you know what Italian food taste then don’t go there cause you will be disappointed, if you don’t know how Italian food taste then stay away cause this won’t be a benchmark.

We thought he copped out by picking the restaurant which is within his housing estate i.e. Tropicana.We were pleasantly surprised!

The Chairman had steak and he certainly enjoyed it.He then insisted that each of us must have an apple tart and I was very glad he did because it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!

The tomato bruchetta is no where close to what it used to be and the pizzas are smaller and less crisp. The mushroom bruschetta is definitely a miss, it is covered with melted cheese and you cannot taste the mushrooms at all. Ironically, the Canneloni, which was one of the best dishes, has been taken off the menu. Another thing I would point is to refrain from ordering the sirloin steak- it was badly seered, rubbery and bland. However, the pasta dishes are good on the whole. The desserts are also not bad overall, I much prefer how it used to be a while back. The tiramisu is either a hit or miss but when its a hit, it is really delicious.

The layout and everything was nice, but the seats were positioned too close together due to the limited space, resulting in a very cramped situation for dining.

"Pael GKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Appalling food,"If you are planning to dine at the social Subang empire, my advice is DONT BOTHER. We went this afternoon for mother's day lunch and I really wish we chose somewhere else. We ordered the green curry chicken, keow teow Chicken Diane and a mixed platter. The Green curry chicken was filled with bits of very stale and spoilt chicken. The curry itself was just oil floating on top of an overly used amount of cumin base. Someone needs to tell the chef that not everything green is a green curry. Needless to say, we didn't eat it. The chicken Diane came with two thin slices of hard and rubbery chicken with a sauce so salty that it was impossible to put in the mouth without having a salt burn. I tried to scrape away the sauce as much as I could and have the hard chicken. It was Mother's Day ans I didn't want my fourteen year old son to feel that I am not enjoying the day. The keow teow was supposed to be with tiger prawns and all that it had was three measly shrimps in it. It is evident that the food was cooked by either the steward or the commis Because no self respecting Chef will actually serve the dishes that was served today. I should know since we run hotels around the country and our executive chefs have taught me quite a bit over the years. The supervisors/ managers were all walking around, looking important, yet no one came to ask us how was the food. I guess they were already aware that they were serving spoilt and terrible tasting dishes, and thus didn't dare to ask. Even the waiters hardly understood English and trying to explain it to them without losing temper would have been impossible.

First time at this outlet and wasn't expecting too much as this a 'generic' restaurant as far as I'm concerned. Food was surprisingly tasty, apart from chili fries - far far too salty. Only tried a selection of starters but all were good. The big thing that lets the place down is lack of attention from staff. We were led to a table and then abandoned and had to try too hard to get a waiter/waitress to attend. The waitress was also very very slow and didn't seem to know what was happening! In addition, I feel the beer is extremely overpriced - 50% more than say J&R Bottle and Boar in SS15, and that was Socials happy hour price. The wine (house wine) is acceptable at the happy hour price for a bottle (RM100). Although having said that I believe reading other reviews that prior to the GST elimination it was RM95! So if that is true then shame on Social for trying to con us.

So it's quite reasonable for the wait & taste. That's quite fast knowing that some restaurants takes about 45mins to prepare or nearly one to half a day to prep the dish to get the smoky fragrant smell.c) Pasta with scallops - at the menu description it states: Pasta Sauteed with large scallops, garlic, basil, olive oil, dried chilli & cream. I had the impression that it would come as something like a bolognaise styled pasta.. but when it was served, the pasta was flooded with the green coloured basil cream sauce =p. I would have enjoyed it more if the cream sauce is lesser.d) Rum & raisin ice cream for dessert - Can't really smell or taste the rum.. quite milky.All in all, waited about 45 - 50 mins for food to start being served to our table. Note: For mains / starters, try to order at the same time. if you want to add any order to your current order, it will be deemed as a new order, so kitchen will only make your new order later (therefore, you have to wait longer for your additional orders to arrive).

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",PELITA PLAZA SHAH ALAM A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Having stayed in Penang for a dozen years, it is natural to have the nasi kandaq instinct in you, that tells you which one in Klang Valley comes closest to the original, which ones are ersatz. So naturally i chose Pelita and the one at Plaza Shah Alam has a decent crowd even during the MCO period. But this visit was rather disappointing: the curry was watery but the bigger flop was the fish roe. Cutting it caused a chunk to fly off the table, and i realised it was that hard because of re heating. One understands nasi kandar operators re heat their dishes but to get that hard must have been due to many re heating. If the Pelita owners are reading this, my plea is, please maintain quality as Penang nasi kandar rep is at stake. Pelita is a chain throughout Malaysia, why it even has a hotel in Penang, eponymously named The Light hotel. Surely the group is concerned about its reputation, and putting hard and elastic fish roe for customers to order is certainly not on.Will steer clear until my nasi kandaq instinct goads me again, against my better judgment.

It was a birthday celebration and one of my friends had done a lot of reading up about the Food Innovator Navin Karu, so we were quite excited to go there.Helas, the restaurant did not live up to its hyped up reputation.We ordered the calamari and the crab cake to start with. Calamari lacked seasoning, bland and soggy. The crab cake was nothing to shout about either.For mains, our order was 2 barramundi and one prawn pasta. Once again big disappointment, the dishes lacked flavour and seasoning. A major hiccup was that on the menu there was no mention of fresh cream being in the barramundi dish, but there was and since I am allergic to fresh cream the dish had to be sent back. I then ordered a lamb pizza which was ok. Long story short, i sat and watched while my other two guests ate their tasteless meal. The pizza arrived after everyone was done eating, except me.

RAMAN KUMAR - is the type of ""captain"" one should always have on a first visit! He made our evening extra special. Attentive. Charming. Making good suggestions on what to eat and drink. Kind enough to take into account the likes and dislikes of his guests. Quick to soothe ruffled feathers (esp mine) with a big smile and suaveness. We started off with cold BERRY BEER. It hit the thirsty throats in just the right spot.The food, we had a variety, was tasty, hot, fresh, served beautifully and service was fast.We tried an odd dish, fried by none other than Darshan himself. Spicy crab fried kway teow. One dish was not enough for us 8 to share.A must have is the mutton curry with toast named MADRAS SPICED LAMB. Tender melt in the mouth lamb and just spicy enough!I loved the BRANDY PRAWN BRUCHETTA. We had a pasta dish SPINACH MUSHROOM which was creamy but not heavy.

"leonintoSingapore, Singapore","Good food, stay away from the wine by the glass","Came here for dinner with the gf and enjoyed the service and food. My gf absolutely loved the spinach mushroom pasta because of the rich flavors of the sauce. The calamari was interesting but not quite what I expected. I'm used to a crispy batter instead of mushy and the chili sauce tasted weirdly like BBQ sauce. The pizza was good.But the house wines are horrible. The shiraz was drinkable, but not really enjoyable. The merlot was trash. Since I know it's not the kitchen staff making the wine, I will be honest about it. Even tho we're paying 26rmb + service/tax, we still left more than half the glass when we left because it was that bad. I've had this happen at other restaurants. Even tho alcholo is expensive due to government taxes, I still think the staff can pick something decent for guests to enjoy with their food.For example, Lavo has 2 cheap red wines (by bottle) for around 100rm that are very drinkable and nice. So, they're making 30 less on the bottle compared to the by the glass price at Vin's but it's easily 5x better.Please fix this.Anyways, stick to beer or wine by the bottle if you know what's good.Show less",4,Reviewed 2 February 2019 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

Anna S,Waited over 2 hours for my food - half of the order never arrived,"I booked on a Friday night, they said they didn't have a table for me but could seat me at the bar. OK. I ordered a bar snack, a main course and a side dish, and proceeded to wait for 2 hours for the food. After about an hour and a half I asked where it was, and was told that there was a problem with the kitchen and they didn't know when it was coming. The waiters then proceeded to ignore me as best they could. There was a woman next to me who walked in 1.5 hours after me and her food arrived straight away which was a bit irritating by that point as I was starving. I was on the verge of leaving when the bar snack finally arrived, however the side orders never materialised. I was so hungry I wolfed it down and then waited a while longer for my main course as it was 10pm and I didn't know where else I could get food at that point. When I asked for the bill I asked for something to be taken off it seeing as I had to wait so long. They didn't really want to and offered me free drinks (which I didn't want.) They reluctantly ended up taking the bar snack off the bill which was not very much considering I left there still hungry and annoyed from only having received half of my order and having wasted 2 hours of my Friday night waiting for half of my dinner.Show less",2,Reviewed 7 December 2018 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

When we arrived the place was already quite busy so there was a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, the service and food did not match. After about 5 minutes we were finally given the menus. It appears there's only one female wait staff whilst the male wait staff seem to only be serving drinks. She seemed responsible for taking orders for the entire restaurant, outside included! The entire night, we needed to flag someone down for service. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered bbq chicken. Sadly my salmon was overcooked and the skin was not that crispy. The bed of creamy spinach which it sat on was ok, however the dish was lacking another texture, something crispy or firm, everything was too soft and got a bit much after a while. The bbq chicken was incredibly bland, grilled chicken with a generic bbq sauce on the side and fries. We decided not to stay for dessert.

CoreyT302,Surprise B'day Party Event - 28/10/2017,"Quick review:Ambiance : 10/10We had our own private room on the second floor and the room is just spectacular. Despite the large crowd outside and another party next room, the room we were in was completely soundproof (amazing!).Food : 7/10Excellent : Bourbon Beef RibsGood : Orange Almond Salad, Bourbon Beef RibsAverage : Creole Tiger Prawns, Ribeye, Seafood Medley PastaTerrible : Vanilla with Rum Comments (only touching on those that needs improvement) : Had a lot of expectation on the steak however was fairly disappointed. We ordered medium rare but was serve almost rare. Didn't ask the kitchen to fix it because everyone was starving (refer to service). The sauce was way too salty and steak was cold. The dessert was really bad as the ice cream was drowning with Rum and the taste was just overwhelming. Almost everyone didn't finish their dessert. The chocolate cake however was phenomenal (must try)!ServiceIt was full house that night hence the delay in food in the beginning but later on it was better (took almost 2.5-3 hours for our 5 meal course). Other than that, Vin's service is always top notch. Tentative from the waiter is on point. Friendliness and a smile is always present with Simon (our waiter serving us for the night). Event coordinator 10/10 - Everything was set up to exactly what I have imagined (balloons, seating plan, music..etc). Thanks Nefertiti.

Why cant they just serve cut chillies on the side to whom ever who needs it. Everything seems to have chillies in it.

"Chirag SKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Absoloutely delicious food but takes extremely long to get to the table.,"Been here a countless number of times and have ordered a variety of different menu items during my visit, all of which were delicious. Special highlights are the brandy prawn appetizer, baked scottish salmon and black cod teriyaki. The fish is always cooked to perfection.Although the actual customer service is pretty good, the food takes really long to come (have waited 1 hour between courses before) and hence why I have given 4 stars instead of 5. Have voiced this problem many times yet nothing changes. The wait at times have ruined the dining experience (hence why I return much less) but the food is definitely fantastic and hence why I still do return those few times.Can be a bit dull when very few tables are occupied but when its busy, there is a relatively good atmosphere.Besides the long wait time, another problem is the dessert. Very limited and besides the molten chocoalte cake, they are all mediocre. Still would recommend to people because the actual appetizers and main courses are super.Show less",4,Reviewed 19 October 2015 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but oh Lord, the food is simply orgasmic. I've been there 5-6 times in the past 3 months, and each time, the food just keeps getting better. I'm a sucker for their carne de vinha, and their local dishes, which are extremely flavorful. I think, hands down, the best lamb ribs I've had in this part of town (and I've been to many restaurants within the city)!Service. Now this is what separates this special place from the rest.

Unfortunately for my expanding waistline, this place is too near home, so I reckon I'll be back many more times!!!My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here, he too, is a big fan of this place. You must try their lamb, which I absolutely love, it's juicy, full of flavor, the duck was simply awesome.. everything, really, everything I've tried, I've loved. Oh ok, but the desserts fall short, perhaps because the mains are too ""WOW"" we tend to criticize the desserts, but really, after such a full meal with wine accompaniment, who's got space left in their belly anyways?I'm so happy I discovered this place.

It is recommended to make reservations especially on Friday night or weekend as the place can get a bit crowded.There is an option to sit outdoors (limited area) or indoors. The ambience indoors is nice and soothing with the lights partially dim which is nice when one gradually sinks into the a relaxed mood heading into the weekend.Before moving on the food the service at this place deserves a special mention. The host showed us to our table and made sure we were comfortable. As it was our first time to the place she suggested a selection of beverages, starters and main course for us to sample. Even during our meal she came over just at the right time when she felt we wanted to order more items. It was a well balanced act which was not overwhelming that one would feel the privacy of one's dining is disturbed. Due to our dietary needs they were kind enough to change some of the topping on their pizza and even made a local noodle dish with a size of 1.5 portions. At one point we were even informed that one particular dish would take an extra 10mins as the chef was preparing it and there was a slight delay.For starters we sampled the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tikka Masala Tapas and Bruschetta. All the items were good and they have made each item their own in terms of taste and presentation.For the main course we had pizza which was customised to our toppings of choice. Next up we had pasta aglio olio which had just the right amount of spice and flavour. One surprising item which we took towards the end was the Penang Fried Noodles. This was recommended by the host and is truly an excellent dish.Finally for the dessert we tried the chocolate truflle cake.

"KebuhKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Excellent casual dining!!,"Had occasion to visit with a group of colleagues recently. Location wise, the establishment is located in a little known commercial block in Taman Tun Dr Ismail about 15km from Kuala Lumpur city centre. Parking is easy and the drive to the restaurant using the Penchala link was much better than using Jalan Damansara.As I had arrived early, decided to check out the bar. I must say that the range of single malt whiskeys available was impressive!! Dinner followed and we really enjoyed the grilled cod and those of us who had the angus steaks were very pleased as well with the selection.A word of warning though, the restaurant is very well ventilated although can get stuffy due to smokers at the Bar. All in all a very pleasurable experience and I would recommend Vin's as a great casual evening out!!Show less",4,Reviewed 22 March 2012 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

FairyFarinaKL,Friendly & Cosy,"I was introduced to Vins somewhere in late 2010 by my partner who lives a few streets away from this cosy bar. Now, my partner and I will visit Vins at least once a month. The first dish I ordered was olio pasta which I find quite tasty. in terms of food, I never had any problem with whatever I ordered. The chefs (James/Mano) are very thoughtful. I remembered there was one time when we walk in the bar at 11.30pm and ordered some food since we were starving but was told by one of the waiter that their kitchen was closed at 11pm. We were dissapointed but decided to have one drink before we head out in search of food. A few minutes later, Lucky and Raman, waiters who usually attend to our need came to check us out. They asked why did we arrived late and why did my partner placed his reservation at 10pm. So we chat and told them that my partner has just finished his job and that's why we were late. We also told them that we were hungry and asked for some groundnuts. Knowing how hungry we were, Lucky spoke to the chef as chef James himself came out to ask what we would like to have.They re-open their kitchen just for us! We ordered their special fried rice and they also served us with hot freshly fried nuts.However, my favourite dish wold be their grill chicken salad. The salad is fresh and the chicken is well seasoned.I considered Vin's to be the best neighbourhood bar. Navin the boss is so friendly and will always stop for a chat with all the patrons whenever he is around.

Capt_BolaKuala Lumpur,"Consistently Good Food, Great Atmosphere","Never mind that the word restaurant is misspelled here, but Vin's is a place that you will want to keep going to over and over. We have tried almost everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. Choose from their tapas selection of fried cod, bruschetta, chicken tikka, lamb masala, to name a few and it goes fantastic with a nice cold glass of Blackthorn cider. The skipjack tuna pizza and moghul masala pizza are superb. The lamb burger is the best we have ever tried. For local fare, you won't go wrong with mamak mee which puts all the mamak shops to shame. A great slection of wines, beers and spirits as well. Make sure you try this place if you are in KL. It's in Taman Tun and traffic can be bad from the city center on weekdays. Just google Vin's and you will get the directions and best to make reservations.

"ShSuKLKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The best in Kuala Lumpur, by far.","Gary Portnoy and Judy Angelo wrote and performed a song called ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" as the theme song for the 1980s television hit-sitcom Cheers. The second time my wife and I went to Vin’s Restaurant and Bar, Taman Tun, Kuala Lumpur in September 2010, some 2 months after it opened, I was reminded of that song. Manish, who variously likes to be called Lucky, stopped us at the door and extended a warm welcome to me and my wife, and referred to us by our names. That was the moment I got completely hooked on the place. In Malaysia, where service standards are dubious at best, we stumbled upon a place where a service staff greeted us by our names on our second visit. I was overjoyed thinking I finally found a place; a brisk 12 minute walk from home; where I felt just like Norm, Cliff and Frasier did, all those years ago.Since that fateful evening in September 2010, we go to Vin’s at least twice a week. Truth be told, at times, its more times in a week than that. I am just fending off any thoughts you might have that we are raving alcoholic lunatics from the onset! To be frank, we go to Vins for 2 reasons. The first and most important reason is Navin, the head honcho of Vin’s, and his team of well trained and warm sidekicks. The second is to do with the fiendishly good food that Chefs Mano and James conjure up at the Vin’s. Now Navin and Chef Mano are the mainstays of the place. Navin infuses his nonchalant yet thoughtful brand of management to his entire team. He’s taught them to be warm and responsive to customers without being overbearing. There’s always someone available to help or to recommend; but no one ever overstays and they all know exactly when to bugger off! Just like Navin. Mano, the head chef really looks like a chef. Call me old fashioned, but I subscribe to the expression, “never trust a skinny cook” and going by that, you’d have nothing but confidence in Mano culinary skills. I understand that it’s a team effort to put food out, but Mano stands at the top of the heap when it comes to cooks who take their craft passionately and seriously. Somewhat diminutive yet with an ample girth, like the author of this piece, Mano puts out diabolically good food. The amiable Chef James, the other wizard in Vin’s kitchen, likewise matches the head chef in gastronomic prowess.These two, together with Navin, have created an array of wonderfully tantalizing dishes. Fusion tapas like the delectable Brandy Prawn Bruschetta; the locally sourced Spicy Lamb Sausages; and the fiery but ‘un-put-down-able’ Chicken Wings will take your taste buds to a different stratosphere.The wacky but completely magical concoctions like the Moghul Masala Pizza, with chicken tikka, feta cheese, onions and coriander, made a well travelled friend of ours from New Zealand, that great nation of rugby maniacs parked at the end of the world, to declare Vin’s pizza the ‘best in the world’.Main courses like the gorgeous Grilled Salmon on a ragout of creamy spinach; the insanely lip-smacking 3-Spiced Ribs; or the luscious Lamb Masala with lashing of simmering spices served with the flat home baked Focaccia will make your taste meter go mental.The beverage selection is outstanding. They have a superb selection beer, both bottled and on tap. And the bar staff are known to make a mean mojito. For the astute whisky drinker, Vin’s has a brilliant assortment, ranging from the ordinary to the sublime. Very few places in KL carry 17-year old Hibiki or Yamazaki from the Suntory stable in Japan or Indian Amrut Fusion Single Malt. Now don’t panic, you’ll also get the usual the Glenfiddich, Macallan and the Auchentoshan. But Navin gets in some wonderful stuff like the 15 year old Bowmore Darkest and less known (in Malaysia) marks like Smokehead from Islay. Vin’s has great ambiance. The décor is understated yet inviting. The music is always pleasant with an eclectic mix of jazz, fusion and soft pop. The clientele is discerning and non judgmental. The people who frequent the joint are local professionals and some interesting expats, usually with their partners. So, thank goodness it does not attract both the leery and the flaunty!The great unwashed tend to flock in on Fridays evenings, so booking may be necessary. Nothing wrong with this, I reckon! Everybody needs to experience Vin’s. Of course, the older and curmudgeonly patrons may not be welcoming the young’uns with open arms. But a good bar and restaurant needs them both in equal measure. The atmosphere on Friday evenings is more rambunctious than normal. Saturdays and Sunday evenings are equally raucous but with a more discerning clientele. The wife and I tend towards weekdays evenings. We do like to feel like part-owners of the place! All in all, if you want a place with excellent food, great ambiance and warm service, in a great neighborhood like Taman Tun in Kuala Lumpur, you‘d be hard pressed to find anything better than Vin’s.Show less",5,Reviewed 16 October 2011 ,Vin's Restaurant and Bar

Recently I had my company function and my colleagues have decided to use this place. It's a cozy restaurant located in PJ with ample parking space. The place is very nicely renovated and I understand it's a newly open restaurant. The staff there are very friendly and always smiling. Of course the most important is the f&b. They serve some of the most delicious food I have tasted for a long time. Even the beers are super cold and fresh. They also have quite a number of whiskeys, gin and wine in their list.

"ECKLKualaLumpurKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Less is More Part 349 - Tantalisingly Tasty Thrifty Treats,"A very charming, tastefully decorated and tidy little outpost in a sea of eateries in Dataran Sunway not far from The Strand. Quite understated on the outside and can be mistaken for a spa centre. Started by the chef owner who spent more than ten years in Bali and fell in love with the cuisine there. His sister manages the front counter. They serve most of the popular Balinese specialities except Babi Guling. But their beautifully chargrilled sate celeng (pork satay) makes up amply for that omission. We liked the sate lilit (minced fish satay) as well, fragrant with lemongrass. Babi kecap manis (stewed pork in dark sweet soya sauce) was particularly good, as was the Pesan be tuna (grilled tuna in banana leaf). Quite unique is the Spicy tuna soup which wasn’t really that hot. The 6 variations of the sharing platter (for four) are an excellent fun way to enjoy more variety. We loved the sambals too which are not too explosive. There were virtually no weak spots in the menu. If I had to grumble, I thought the vegetable dishes like the fried cabbage and long beans were too plain-tasting. Otherwise everything else was fine and the prices are more than reasonable. Don’t overlook the desserts - Bubur sumsum being our favourite. Finish off the meal with a strong cuppa of Kopi Bali. Show less",4,Reviewed 25 December 2018 ,The Uma Bali

noisyminor,Invited friends here but a but disappointed ,"We have been visiting this restaurant since it was established years ago when parking wasn't an issue like last night. Maybe it was a busy Friday night and we had a big group, the service was a bit letdown. I ordered a drink and asked for no sugar but if came as ""MORE"" sugar and I had to send it back to exchange. We ordered a brownie e with ice cream after the meal, not only it was more than half an hour wait but we were given the wrong dessert! We declined and left in disappointment.The serving was huge in single sets. I wasn't aware of this as I normally order sets for 4 people to share. Then I ordered some extra dishes yo share and it turned out to be too much food and we had to take away the leftover. I recommend sharing (ordering) a set first then decide if you want add-ons as it could be too much and they don't know how to warn you.

"Kenix LKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Excellent taste! Great food! Reasonable price!,"Came here in a group of 8 just for casual gathering, as recommended by of one of guests. It's a Saturday night, parking was easy to find and its located in The Strand shophouses in Kota Damansara. The ambience was really nice. We were seated on the ground floor. Simple decor yet very welcoming and cozy. The balinese music on the background was soothing. It's fullhouse on the ground floor all by reservations when we arrived. We visited the first floor while waiting for our food. It's beautifully designed. The paddy field scenery with sit on the platform setting makes it such a cozy and relaxing place. My friend ordered 2 sets of the 4 person sharing platter. It has got 3 main dishes, and a variety of side dishes (more than 10). Ordering food here is simple and easy! The food came. We were all awed by the portion and presentation of the food. RM118 for a platter for 4 person! I remembered paying 70 odd bucks for platter just as appertizers in one of the other balinese restaurant around. The taste was marvellous. The crispy fried duck, bbq pork ribs, lemongrass flavoured grilled chicken, pork satay were very delicious. The pork sausage (which we were told homemade using fresh pork intestine) were a pleasant surprise. The sambals were great and delicious - sambal embo (not sure of the correct spelling, the one with fried onions and chilli) was really good with rice, and the sambal tomato was delicious too, though on a spicy side. We spoke to the young owner cum chef and was told that careful considerations were given in selecting the combination of the food in each of the basket to maximise flavour and texture variety. We all think that they did it perfectly well! Brilliant mind! I strongly recommended this place. To say it's the best Balinese restaurant is an understatement. It's actually one of the best restaurant around. Drinks: stick to the refreshing drinks on offer: lemongrass drink, fresh cucumber with lime and mint and markisa with lime and mint! They were all good! The portion were big, we were too full to try the dessert. Will be back for sure. Show less",5,Reviewed 30 November 2015 ,The Uma Bali

Staff not so great","For a restaurant with enough seats for up to 30 (based on the number of chairs they laid out), I expected the food to be amazing. When I saw that most of the very good reviews on Tripadvisor, I walked in. For starters, the staff didn't seem too eager to have me and my friend for dinner - we were the only two persons there on a Sunday evening. Two other persons dropped in after awhile. So with just 4 of us, I thought perhaps the staff would engage in some conversation to recommend us some signature dishes there. They didn't even bother, instead they were looking out at the street half dreaming. I ordered fried chicken with Balinese herbs with yellow rice and some veges as side dishes. My friend had her grilled pork ribs set. Sadly, her (overly cooked) set which was served together with mine was cool instead of hot. It's as though they left her set while mine was being prepared so both sets could be served together. My fried chicken was very nicely done and I especially enjoyed the refreshing lemongrass drink too.

The 4 of us was suitably intrigued to explore and wow , were we pleasantly surprised. Ambiance was good, with ground floor more modern while first floor was more traditional. Suitable Balinese music soothed us and good AC with good service throughout the meal. The menu is not extensive, nasi ratus predominates with about 15 types of mains to choose from. This is rice with a few appetizers, cooked vege , sauces and lovely string fries we could not get enough of.There is a la carte options of appetizers, two soups, about 4-5 desserts and some choice of non alcoholic drinks. You can bring your own wine with no corkage which is of course what we did. Though bringing own glass might be a good idea too.Now on to the food, after some fifteen minutes and being the only ones there, the rice arrived with the platter and conversation stopped; only to be punctuated by, mmmm this is so good. everything tastes marvelous ! And not much msg judging from the after effects. My favorite was the pork ribs, sausage that reminds me so much of Chiangmai Sai o, the tuna with shallots. The fried duck was very good too but the others were better. The uma's satay asem and satay lilit was also good, juicy and tasteful without being excessively oily, unlike bumbu bali's.

They had a parking space reserved and we gave the car number. But then, another car just parked there and we had to use another spot.2. One of the Captain however did help out with escorting my mum after we parked. 3. They had a small Wedding reception. As such, they pushed my 2 tables back to the main dining hall. 4. The Captain (Windy Cheong) came to apologise but I told her no need to discuss anymore. 5. We then ran through the menu again which was accurate.6. First dish was served with pretty good decorations (although decorations was more for CNY) and tasted quite OK.7. Then there was quite a long time gap before the next dish. 8. Then the fish dish came out which was a bit overcooked. 9. But before we could finish eating the fish, another 3 dishes appeared in quick succession. 10. I told them to hold on but they just kept serving despite me telling the waiter, the Captain and the Cashier (owner was sitting near the counter but he just kept quiet).11. The restaurant was very busy that night and we ended up changing the plates ourselves. 12. Overall, food was so so as compared to the time we had with you.13. Ms Windy Cheong was not seen the whole time until our dinner was nearly over as she was busy upstairs. She came to apologise. 14.

Total bill came up to RM106.60 nett.My favorite are the tomyam seafood and steamed fish with garlic & lime. Well executed and I requested for extra spicy for both of this dish’s. Tom Yum broth has balance of sweetness to it too, yummy trust me for it. Fish are fresh , but the chef could clean the fish better by scaling the fish properly. It’s not very nice eating half way and u need to pick the scale out. Other than that, have sufficient soup and the balance of spiciness and sourness are greatHowever somtum has no umami from the fish sauce as it’s just bland with slight spicy. This dish I will passed, as no presence of dried shrimps alsoThe noodles are quite nice with the “wok hei” but portion are small and enough for an small eater only.

The brocolli was fresh, crunchy and was surrounded by bell peppers, onions, black olives and feta cheese. The spaghetti was basic with some olives but the portion could have been a bit more generous.

You can certainly feel the love restaurant had for pork with walls decorated with cute and dorky pig paintings. It's only half past 6, crowd had started, waiting to be seated. Ordered a dog food (yes,it's on the menu), soft rib and today's special pork rib. The dog food had to be my favourite! The gravy topped with gooey melting cheese, and deep fried French fries, a match made in heaven.

Great first impression. As we entered this restaurant, we noticed that space was quite limited and tables were small and placed close together to sit maximum number of patrons. Don't expect a typical American diner with booths and soft cushioned benches.Items on the menu are quite limited. House salad was fresh though not spectacular. Soup of the day contained pieces of ham was pretty average. The baby back ribs was delicious, though the portion was about half of a typical American portion in the States. Probably this portion size suited most of their customers well as I noticed over 90% of them were locals when we were there.Mashed potatoes were fantastic, it came with a very delicious gravy. Pig in a blanket was a novelty, cocktail sausages wrapped in bacon was pretty average. For dessert we can apple crumble which was very good even though it was a tad too sweet. It was served with Vanilla ice-cream. Their chocolate ice-cream was good. We were told the ice-cream was imported from Iowa.Overall still a pleasant and enjoyable meal, even though we would prefer booths with solid tables and American portions of food.

Basically, I was eating the ice cream and the sweet filling (that was cooked together with the apple slices) more than anything else. When I have just completed my meal, 5 minutes later this uncle (whom I presume is the owner/owner's family) came and asked us if we need any additional orders with a smile.

We didn't really mind but with such a big space, they could put more tables rather than just 12. The ambience is not bad. The menu was simple and unfortunately the food we wanted to order was not available anymore (even though it was only 7ish in the evening). If the waitress inform us when she sit us down rather than telling us when we were ready to order would gain some brownie points from us. We had the fresh scallops with salted egg yolk puree and shaved parmesan. Scallops were cooked perfectly however the whole salted egg yolk and parmesan thing was alright. With everyone trying to come up with a dish using salted egg yolk nowadays makes it less special. Honestly, in my opinion, I find this appetiser weird. It doesn't seem to blend well. I had the duck confit for my entree. Portion was rather small for the price that I was paying and it was very salty for my liking that I had to keep eating it with the mashed. I had to drink loads of water to wash down the saltiness the rest of the evening which was not so pleasant. The mashed potato was alright, wish that it was more smooth.

Jacqueline FKuala Lumpur,Great food and value for money!! Love it!!,"WhupWhup is a really unique place - a restaurant run by a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef inside an old factory, which has been cleaned out and decked out to serve hearty soul food and expertly crafted coffee.Chef Liang and the young team that runs the place made sure they kept as much of the factory's character in the restaurant, which makes for a lot of quirky, Instagram-worthy touches. Some of the machines were artfully turned into tables and coffee bars, a huge ""Safety First"" sign remains on the mezzanine, and there's a huge industrial-size steel water tank hanging at the back.The space itself is absolutely huge, which makes it perfect for big parties and private functions -- especially if you want the post-event photos to look really interesting and unique.NOW TO THE FOOD AND DRINK. The head barista used to be a trainer with Barista Guild Asia, so he knows his stuff. I'm not the most discerning coffee drinker, so all I can say is that it tasted good. I liked it. We had good times. #AcidityWhatAcidity?As for the food, I've tried the glazed lamb shank with ratatouille and roasted potatoes a couple of times, and it was AMAZING each time. You could put that glaze on a car tire and it would still taste good. The itself lamb falls of the bone, and the whole dish is just so hearty and filling.I've also had the Duck Three Ways, which seems to be a favourite. It comes with succulent duck breast on a bed of pasta cooked with SALTED DUCK EGG YOLK and DUCK BACON (talk about a triple threat!). Personally, I like my salted egg yolk to be smooth and runny, but the treatment on this one's a bit different - it has more texture to it. Still, it's a very decadent dish, one of those that will put a smile on your face when you're done.In terms of dessert, I will definitely recommend The Babyface -- a chocolate tart that's really rich and smooth. You gotta try it. The serving's a little small for me, but then again, I'd take a mountain of that goodness and it still wouldn't be enough.Price-wise, it's very reasonable considering the portions and quality. The lamb shank - one of the most expensive items on the menu - is around RM35 (if I remember correctly), Duck Three Ways is RM20-something (RM25??), and The Babyface is RM10. Coffee prices are pretty much standard Klang Valley prices la.It's a great place to go with friends and family, because Chef Liang and his team have created a really warm, friendly environment. Pair that with good food and coffee, and you've got a recipe for good times all around.Show less",5,Reviewed 29 January 2016 ,WhupWhup

We booked the ‘glass house’ with decorated table as the main area was fully booked. We paid an extra upfront rm100 for the deco and were given options on theme colour (pics communicated via WHATSAPP). Deco was old school but sweet nonetheless.

We shared the clam chowder (which I thought was a touch bit too salty but my husband liked it that way). Seafood jambalaya was good and generous with the seafood. Steak Fillet mignon portion was good sized but could do with abit more seasoning of the meat. (We were recommended the lamb but we’re not big fans of lamb so opted for beef instead).

As the alumni of a university in louisiana, we really looked forward to bring back some good memories from the food of this restaurant. The result was totally disappointed.

"toozgxSubang Jaya, Malaysia",Spaghetti buffet? Why not.,"Having read an online article at the end of 2015 listing a number of the best restaurants in the Klang Valley are, Secret of Louisiana bagged the category for best budget buffet. Much to my surprise, spaghetti was the main item, at a very attractive RM19.90++ for all-you-can-eat.Soon enough me and my friends made plans and now I write this review after having just tried it (February 2016), I can say that the verdict is good.They offer a selection of 13 different pastas. Along with that, they served free-flow ice lemon tea, soup of the day, garden salad, garlic bread as well as 1 ice-cream per pax.The pastas were small portioned. But since it's an all-you-can-eat, the small portions were preferable, as we get to try the variety of flavours they offered. As for taste, they were reasonably well flavoured, definitely far from disappointing. My favourites were the Mexican Aglio Olio and the Beef Bolognaise, all which were done rather well.The decor of the place was a plus point. Delightfully homey while not being too tacky, the atmosphere does feel like what a typical Louisiana diner would be like. Service was mostly pleasant, the servers were responsive and friendly despite the huge crowd that was there.The few things that might irk people are that some of the pastas were warm, not pipping hot. I don't mind it as much because I suppose this is the best they can do granted it is an all-you-can-eat. Also towards the later part of lunch service, food came a little slower, as I can observe the staff being a little short-handed due to the crowd.In conclusion, if you have a huge appetite and a love for pastas, by all means try this place. For such a price, I'd be hard-pressed to look for complains. Just take note that service is better during the early part of lunch service (we were there from 12pm).*This review is for the Spaghetti Buffet part of the restaurant menu. They also have an ala carte menu which I've yet to try, but am curious to some time in the future. For that I might write a separate review.Show less",4,Reviewed 4 February 2016 ,Secret of Louisiana
"JonathanLienKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sure sounds like a great idea!,"I work with people from Louisiana, and I've been on a work trip there. Absolutely love the place, the people, the shopping (this is great countrywide) and especially the food! So when I got back here I've been raving about crawfish and etouffee and craving for such foods all the time! When I found out about this place, I was ecstatic and rounded up the family and headed there almost immediately. The location is awesome. A lot of parking, easy access, you eat facing a lake (not a great lake, just A lake) and the waiters were very very nice. Great crew there. Prior to getting there I had visited the restaurant's website and discussed the wonderful spread with my boss (from Louisiana) and he knows all the dishes, which makes this very authentic. There were no prices listed online (that I could see), which is somewhat to be expected. When we got there I had ordered up a feast for 3 adults and a toddler. We had certainly over ordered but I was just too excited to try everything! The crawfish was very very expensive, but I just had to try them. If it's your first time eating such food then you will certainly walk away very satisfied and happy. However, this was not the case for me. The menu looked and sounded authentic but not the taste. The crawfish wasn't as fresh as I would have expected, seeing they had some live ones on display. Not sure if we're served live ones or frozen ones. The etouffee was nice on its own but not exactly how I remembered it to taste like. If you've been to Louisiana and hoping to replicate the taste here, be prepared to be disappointed. If you're having this for the first time, you would likely enjoy the meal. Bottom line, the price does not justify the portions as although it's a large portion served, the actual 'good stuff' that you're after is very little. There's heaps more other stuff and garnishing thrown in instead to make the portion seem large - get what I mean?Show less",3,Reviewed 15 December 2015 ,Secret of Louisiana
Joyce L,Not impressed,"We went for the spaghetti buffet but our overall experience didn't live up to its hype. The environment was okay - the chairs and tables outdoor was low quality and really flimsy and they serve with plastic plates and bowls. The spaghetti itself were alright, portions were small but I suppose it fits the purpose of a buffet. The Mexican Aglio Olio was delicious, however there are little to non-existing protein in the other spaghetti dishes (ie there are only 3 small pieces of fish in my fish pesto spaghetti and also the chicken carbonara). Drinks were horrible. The ice lemon tea we ordered was tasteless and bitter! Mushroom soup was alright but garlic bread was disappointing. The ""garlic bread"" were bite-size sliced baguettes baked with margarine and had no garlic whatsoever. The ice-cream served at the end had a strange and unpleasant taste. With our experience going downhill from the start we've pretty much given up on our food by the end of it. The only positive comment I can give was the decent service and the Mexican Aglio Olio. The price for the buffet itself wasn't expensive - however they are only screaming the obvious by serving low quality food to the customers.Show less",2,Reviewed 8 August 2015 ,Secret of Louisiana

However, the standard wasn't as good during the event - some of the food were not as tasteful (probably because they were prepared in big batches), plus the food was not being kept warm enough. All in all, I would say the standard was just average. They are however well known for their lunch promo, which is another reason why our food took a long time to arrive during the tasting.

Take your pick on the type of meat you want - ribs, lean or fat meat, innards, etc. You can also add enoki mushrooms, choy sum (green leafy vegetable), fu zhuk (friend beancurd sheets) and side orders of yau char gwai (fried dough fritters).

Meng Yang N,Great Varuval chicken curry but inconsistent overall quality,"At its best, the Indian curries particularly the varuval chicken is fantastic and spicy.

Mrsaidasantino,Too pricey,"This place was recommended by my friend. Since we like to try Indian food, so we came here. Service was ok nothing great, food was average something we could still find back in jakarta, price is something they need to look into.

"georgeabin2005Ernakulam, India",The curry world,The krishna curry house in PJ is really a good one. It's the best place in the area to get south Indian food.

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Possibly among the best,"This remains our family go-to restaurant. Their fried fish, varuvel and paratal, crab curry, cutlets are among the best around and they do not have many 'off' days. Service could be better as the rest does get a little crowded and you may be forgotten every once in a while. Best to get here well before the lunch or breakfast crowd gets in. Pricing is a little on the high side although it is to be expected of banana leaf restaurants. Show less",4,Reviewed 16 July 2016 ,Krishna Curry House
"snowy1_66Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Banana Leaf Lovers,"If you are a Banana Leaf Lover, then you should not miss this place. I have been to this restaurant a couple of time. One thing I love about this restaurant is they are generous in their vegetable portion. Food is really good. I love their chicken curry, mutton, sambar, crab rasam, chicken varuval, fry fish and etc. This restaurant is located in Petaling Jaya and it's has parking space. But you need to be there a bit early to find space for parking as lunch time is crowded. In term of pricing, they are reasonable and i would say, value for money. So check this place out.

"Kiret100808Shah Alam, Malaysia",Pathetic Service... Lack of Manners,"Food was okay...i try many different food outlets all around Klang Valley and i was terribly disappointed with my visit here...I was not given proper information on the pricing of the food as i took one set of banana leaf briyani, but i had two others with me who were just gonna share that meal with me... They had banana leaves served for them as well and all was fine... once i was done, for a serving of briyani (rm7 actual price) and claypot curry (rm10), fresh milk and lassi, i paid nearly rm35.... i was surprised and when i questioned the cashier to show me the receipt... he stared me down while vigorously pulling out the receipt from the printer and lightly smacked it on my palms... i became furious with such an attitude, because that is not how you treat your customers... people come here to pay for what they eat, and when they are charged, they are entitled to know exactly what was billed for them, which is what i did....i saw some other food items registered in the my receipt but he refused to give the money back as he said i ordered those items and havent paid for it.Despite the food being alright, what ticks me off is bad service and unfriendly workers. It is my last time going back there, and i would recommend better places for briyani.. My favourite thus far : Nirvana Maju at Bangsar and Klang Bawah Jamabatan, Jalan Pengkalan (Wed and Fri for briyani)..Cheers !Show less",1,Reviewed 22 September 2014 ,Krishna Curry House

"gracelimshHorley, United Kingdom",Fantastic food!,"We were back from abroad, visiting family in Subang and they recommended this place which they said served Thai street food which was different to the usual Thai fare. I was sceptical at first but I was soon proved wrong.The restaurant itself is quite small and it does get busy, so it’s a good idea to get there early. It’s a no frills restaurant, so don’t expect anything fancy.We had the green curry, pork skewers, papaya salad, quail’s eggs, chicken wings and tom yam soup. All the dishes were excellent, especially the green curry which was thick and delicious. The pork skewers were also very good, tender and very tasty. My son had the durian cheesecake for dessert and that was absolutely divine!We enjoyed it so much that we went back two days later! They do set meals for lunch which are very good value. We will definitely be back next year!Show less",5,Reviewed 15 April 2019 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food
"LobsterlyySubang Jaya, Malaysia",Servers missed our order,"My bf and I were already very hungry when we came in, and managed to get last order (9pm). However, they forgot to key in one of our mains and when we complained, they merely apologised meekly and said nothing can be done. I understand that human mistakes can happen, but now we will have to set off to find another place to satisfy our hunger pangs. Maybe the place should’ve offered some free snacks/drink as a compensation? The best they did was to recommend us to order dessert, but who would even eat dessert before their mains ??Was not satisfied .Show less",1,Reviewed 14 December 2018 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food

"Leonj59Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Okay,This is essentially a pork based eatery - almost identical to what you would find in a typical Bangkok shop. There was only 1 single chicken based dish throughout the menu - a green curry. This was ok although I could tell that it had the potential to be better if they would just up the ante on the spice. I liked the tako but the Red Ruby was disappointing-coarse iceShow less,3,Reviewed 18 January 2018 ,Boran Classic Thai Street Food
