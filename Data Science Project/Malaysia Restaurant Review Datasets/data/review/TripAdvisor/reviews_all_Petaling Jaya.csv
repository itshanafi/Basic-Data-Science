Pixel8Malaysia,Horrible first time for 4,"Decided to try out the degustation sets here for anniversary dinner on a 11.11 weeknight. Our first time here turned to be a mistake overall. Food taste was amateurish, couldnt get the mix of ingredients here there. My deluxe set's only saving grace was the grilled langoustines but that was it. Sea urchin was bad, had to reject it and got replaced with a good one. The supposedly signature lamb for mains was just rubbery and old with tendons; the mushroom sides had sand/dirt which i was crunching into, urgh. Other 3 sets were just as bad, seabass mains were bland and mushy (not fresh). Duck was bland. Fortunately the chosen Rongopai house white was good to wash it all down. Turned out the usual chef was on long break,leaving the assistants to hold the fort. Not a good risk, this is what can hurt reputations, bad timing really. Hope the other 3 tables of customers had better luck that night.Show less",1,Reviewed 16 November 2020 ,Bistro a Table
redthevirgindragon,Private and good,"Love the corner table with curtain, we got a little private area as it was a special occasion. Chef came around the table a couple of times to check up on us. The waiter was and friendly but had a bit of trouble with the communication. Had to repeat what I said a few times, but it didn't really boil me because I don't like to make a big deal about it and it was a special event. No point spoiling it. Food was lovely. Had the 4-course degustation menu, and ordered a couple of other dishes to add-on. It was lovely and not too overwhelming as we wanted a light, slow and enjoyable dinner. Duck was the star of the night and risotto was amazing. They change menu every month, so please call and ask for the latest menu. Not everyone would enjoy French cuisine, so please go with an open mind. I love it!Show less",4,Reviewed 7 October 2020 ,Bistro a Table

"EnglishGarden12Selangor, Malaysia",Perfect for a romantic date night ,"My partner and I went to Bistro a Table last Saturday night for a treat on date night.He chose one of the 6 course taster menus, whilst I had the baked French onion soup followed by the seabass. I have to say the soup was absolutely the best onion soup I have ever had and all the food was cooked to perfection!We really appreciated the fact that chef Isadora came to our table to take our orders, talked us through the menu and come back to us several times throughout the evening to discuss the food. We had also notified the restaurant in advance of my garlic intolerance and Isadora was so informative and helpful, offering suggestions and ways she could adapt the menu for me.The ambiance of the restaurant was romantic, private and quiet - perfect for a romantic evening.Honestly, I’ve lived in Selangor for two years and I think it’s my favourite restaurant in PJ!

Andrew D,"Our first visit to Bistro a Table, PJ","Warning - this is an in-depth review of the food and ambience at one meal......This was our first visit to Bistro a Table, planned for some time after learning about Chef Isadora and her standard of excellence, and finally it happened. We do not eat meat, but there was still enough choice of intriguing looking dishes to tempt us. For starters we chose the smoky tomato soup (with potato cloud!) and the stuffed zucchini flowers, and they were both excellent, the soup especially so with its unique flavour and presentation. The mains chosen were the truffle risotto and grilled seabass, with a delicious artichoke salad and a simple green salad as side dishes. I say simple, but in fact it is quite difficult to actually get what should be a simple green salad with a proper dressing, generally they have a poor choice of salad leaves, and tomatoes and other vegetables added, and then little or no dressing (or something sweet...) which shows the chef has no real idea about what constitutes a green salad - or has handed it over to the kitchen junior to prepare...... all that is wanted is a variety of fresh young green salad leaves and a simple french dressing (not sweet!), and that makes a perfect green salad....and happily, finally, this is what we had at Bistro a Table. Most do not get this; Chef Isadora clearly does. I have rather focused on this simple dish, because it is so unusual to get it properly prepared, and demonstrates very effectively the quality, competence and attention to detail of this kitchen.The artichoke salad was recommended by the chef, and certainly did not disappoint; it was loaded with flavour and texture: mushrooms, artichoke (of course) and crunchy celery, in its own unique dressing, and we intend to recreate it at home if we can, it was so good.The grilled seabass is uncomplicated, and just needs to be cooked perfectly to be - well, perfect - and it was, delicious. Precisely judged cooking of fish is an art....I have saved the truffle risotto until last, because, my word, it was good! A wonderful rich, creamy concoction of perfectly cooked rice with an intense truffle component, bursting with complex flavours, and was probably the best risotto we can remember tasting. No more words needed...With great regret we concluded we had no room to do justice to the dessert menu, a huge disappointment, and if there is any criticism at all, it is that the dishes are a tad too generous.....you don't want to leave anything, but then you (we, anyway) have little room left for dessert....not recommended at all! Chef Isadora came to our table several times during the meal, which is in any case, made our visit a memorable experience, but finally wanted to know why we had not chosen a dessert(!) - on our next visit (and there most certainly be one) we intend to ensure room will be reserved for dessert(s).....Related to the meal, we had several glasses of wine (we prefer white), and the wine quality certainly enhanced our experience. Not forgetting the quiet competence of the service, which was everything you could hope for, this was made extra special with the Chef's visits to our table to discuss food (and desserts!).The restaurant itself is easy to find, and exhibits a delightful clean, understated excellence inside, with unusual lighting and an interesting variety of unique framed posters (I suspect selected by Chef Isadora herself - if you see them you will understand why I say this!). Also it needs to be said; most French restaurants (in France) have disposable paper table covers, which makes obvious sense for diners that love to eat - and we were very pleased to see this in Bistro a Table. It is perhaps a small matter, but simply adds to the whole experience, and makes you appreciate the professionalism of the Chef and her intention to provide a true french ambience in quiet PJ.Overall, the thing that most stands out is the quality of the ingredients - if these are not first class, nothing else can be. Happily the quality stood out in all respects, and this is a jewel of a restaurant to have in a quiet suburb, and within 10 minutes drive of our home too! As a final note, we had no problem to safely park nearby, in fact the whole commercial area is well organised for parking, considerably better than many places in KL.Show less",5,Reviewed 26 August 2019 ,Bistro a Table

There are many good things about this place - the creativity in the foods, the tastiness, the very cosy design and the attentive service we received from Maitre’d Faisal was impeccable from reservation to the end of our dinner that night. We did have a great time! The only two constructive comments which I would put in here are 1. The pan fried sea bass’ skin was a tad soft and 2. The restaurant gave us a nice designed writing on our dessert “happy 16th anniversary”. However, the dessert wasn’t complimentary. In most of our anniversary years celebrated in other restaurants around the world, we tend to receive a nice surprise from the restaurants we celebrate it. In fact in some, we received complimentary champagne or desserts or sweets. Lastly, I find it odd that the chef came out to greet a table with many ladies celebrating their friend’s birthday, however she didn’t feel it important to come ask how we enjoyed ourselves that night.

"SphingxKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","A lot of style, but very little substance. Left the place hungry.","Several people raved about this place. After going there, I do not understand why.The pros:The service from the waiter is some of the best I've ever encountered in a KL restaurant, even in some of the top hotels. It's friendly, attentive, non-snobbish. Downright fantastic.The cons:The food. Don't get me wrong. The food is not bad. It's not fantastic either, it's just kind of slightly above average with a lot of frills to shill it as something extraordinary. They have a very fancy menu with reams of superlative information describing the food. Did you know that you can make any food sound fancy by adding the place of origin before the item itself? For example (this is not the exact item on the menu, just a demonstration of the style): Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops in Irish cream sauce, or Australian fillet mignion, served with Chilean asparagus or Tuscan rabbit or something (yes that was sarcasm). All these only serve to make the food sound more impressive than it is. There is even this really expensive dessert called 'And Ode to Newton' which has its own special card describing how it's anti-gravity and avant garde and all that, but basically is a scoop of ice cream on a wafer of flavoured ice on a glass of ginger beer. All for the bargain price of RM 25+This would not be such a bad thing if the portions were so minuscule for how much they charge you (RM 50-80 for a main). You order saddle of rabbit and you get one tiny little piece barely bigger a 50 sen coin. The duck breast was supposedly served with mash but what you actually get is a little dollop that looks like it had been served with a teaspoon.I don't mind paying for quality, but when a place is hyped but turns out to be so much style, and so little substance, it's really underwhelming. And honestly, if you paid 1k for one meal for a party of 5, I would have expected everyone NOT to leave the place hungry. The only way I'd ever recommend this restaurant to anyone if they and their wallet want a bit of weight loss, and if you enjoy the ambience and the prestige of having that kind of money to burn, I suppose.Show less",3,Reviewed 7 December 2014 ,Bistro a Table

"LWilsonnKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Left with the bitter taste!,"It was a beautiful cozy restaurant nestling in the quiet neighbourhood, the restaurant lighting is just nice, warm and welcoming, and the decor of the restaurant is simple, and great! They don't have a big menu but it's sufficient. Some might felt a lil pinch for the price of the food but I think it is reasonably priced for a French (fusion) Dining. Since the restaurant has less patrons for the night, our food is served quite fast.Some warm breads and butter were served soon after, and our appetiser was brought out almost instantly as just moment prior I spread the butter onto my bread. And like the other reviewer has mentioned, for a moment I thought it was an amuse bouche! Usually a fine dining restaurant will serve you chilled but spreadable butter but the butter they brought to our table is still hard and impossible to spread it onto the bread. Since our first course is served, we just put aside our 'amuse bouche' and start enjoying our meal. We have their signature coddled maple syrup egg with Fluer de Sel & crouton dust, and cream of cauliflower soup. Our first course are nicely presented and the food is good, but not great!As for the main, we have cannelloni of seared scallops & school prawns in lobster bisque and Indonesia black nut tapenade, and duck breast a l'orange with puy lentils & candied kumquats. As expected, the food presentation is good but the cannelloni is cold. The plate is still luke warm to the touch but the food is indeed cold. To our utterly dismay, the duck breast is a total let down! Despite having good and mixed reviews, I can't comment on others' plate but I can only reviewing what's on my plate. Having myself as a big fan of duck, I expect nothing less from a French fine dining restaurant. I expect my duck breast seared to perfection, with either a lil crispy skin on top or the fats has rendered, and meat is pink in the middle, and I thought that is the expectation from a great chef too! But what put in front of me is a huge disappointment, the duck skin is neither crispy nor cook perfectly. The fats are still stretchy & too chewy, indicating it's not rendered enough, thus leaving it to be extremely chewy. The meat doesn't cook proper and evenly, leaving some part of the meat still raw! We addressed the concern to the lady manager or perhaps the owner, and without even bringing back our food to the kitchen and informed the chef, she immediately defended herself saying their duck breast is cooked it that way! We leave with no option but to bite our teeth and continue to consume the 'cook' part and leaving the raw part aside. It's almost impossible to eat the chewy duck skin and what a big shame that we just can't finished the whole dish, leaving half of it go wasted!The lady come by and trying to check on us again. Without any shadow of doubts, we explained to her on our disappointment. She almost if not immediately starting to defend herself and arguing that she has check with the chef and the duck is cook to the perfection, without even bringing back our dish huh?! I wonder how true it is that the chef is well-informed! She continued to argue that the duck breast is cook without the crispy skin as per Chinese style roast duck and it's pink in the middle. We explained to her that we totally understand this is not a Chinese style roast duck and certainly did not expect the skin to be thin and crispy! We are dining in a French restaurant and we knew what we are in for, mind you! And I told her the duck meat is still raw in some part, and I'm using the word RAW, she keep arguing it is suppose to cook it that way and it's pink in the middle. Personally, I have dined in quite a numbers great restaurants and some are run by Michelin starred chefs all around the world but never had in my life, be served a raw duck breast! She continued to defend herself by mentioning none customers complaining about the way they cooked the duck... By the time, she has really gotten under my nerves and I just point to her directly the raw part with my fork and questioning her whether is that 'pink in the middle' which she keep mentioning? We can see she caught in surprised when I pointed exactly where the raw part is, and she remained silent for a second, before telling us, 'Yes, I have check with the chef and this is how it is cooked'. I knew our conversation will lead us to no where and I really got pissed off with her attitude! She left our table without even apologised, not to mention bringing us back another well-seared duck breast! And if this happened in overseas, they can even get sued for serving raw meat to the patrons whom may coming back later with some serious food-borne disease!I don't mean to sound rude but if this the way they are treating the customers, i believe the business won't go too far into the future! Pictures do tell thousands word, and if the duck skin can be stretched to that afar, please tell me it's has rendered enough and it's not chewy! And please tell me the meat is cook to perfection and pink in the MIDDLE! I expect nothing less for the food with the price they are charging, and definitely not with this kind of attitude! I'm trying to be polite here but if you are expecting good French food, beware that your food might come with an attitude as your sides! Put your money elsewhere, where you can enjoy real good French food, and with genuine great service!Show less",1,Reviewed 8 September 2014 ,Bistro a Table

"mesotheliumKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Pushes the boundaries of KL dining,"Since opening Bistro a Table a little more than 3 years ago, chef and owner Isadora Chai has been a polarising figure to dining in the Klang Valley. Some can't get enough of her creative efforts in her kitchens, returning nearly every month to sample the newest menu. Others don't appreciate what is being done here and feel that the food is overpriced for an out of the way shoplot in a residential area.The cuisine here is generally described as strongly French influenced with Malaysian elements and with an eclectic ""Isadora"" touch. Nowhere is this more evident than her infamous weekly degustation nights which feature her most ""out there"" creations under an overriding theme. Some items remain on the menu most of the time -- the signature dessert ""Ode to Newton"", for instance, and the maple coddled egg appetiser. Other items are seasonal.Chef Isadora Chai's enthusiasm for her work is evident both in her cooking and the enthusiasm with which she talks to guests who are interested in knowing more about the food. She goes to great lengths to source the most appropriate ingredients for a dish, e.g. the finest truffles of the season, or the freshest fish she can find. This unrelenting pursuit for quality is reflected in the prices -- despite the ""bistro"" moniker, a meal here is not ""cheap"".One cautionary note here is that food here is not ""conservative"" so diners who come here expecting a classic French meal -- ris de veau aux champignons, tournedos Rossini, or maybe a vanilla creme brulee -- will be sorely disappointed. Examples of dishes in the past: hazelnut roti jala with a Valrhona creme anglaise, pan-seared Red Pearl fish with salted cod brandade & tobiko buerre blanc. There are also some drawbacks to this experimentation: it might seem at times that the food being presented is more ""experimental"" than it is ""good"". But this seems like a small price to pay for the chance that you will find yourself ""wowed"" by a taste combination that you never realised would work.Four stars -- this place is good and I return here time and again but there's ""something"" missing that would make it truly great.Show less",4,Reviewed 9 August 2014 ,Bistro a Table
"Travelicious_KKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Worth the gamble,"It was my first time here and I took a gamble taking visiting colleagues from overseas for dinner, based on the reviews I read online, but it was worth it. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the presentation of each dish was fab! Very nicely done. If I had any feedback to give, it'll be that the food took a while to be prepared. The bottle of white wine we ordered wasn't chilled, so that's something that they can improve on.

"rlloyd2605Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",An ordinary restaurant that thinks it is something special,"We visited this restaurant as two other restaurants close by which we knew to be good were fully booked. This one was not, and that should have told us something from the word go, Bistro a Table is expensive with first courses being in the RM30 to 50 range and main courses at RM80. So one can reasonably expect something special. In fact we found it to be generally good but no more. The first courses we chose for our party of three were coddled egg ( ie a very lightly boiled egg) this was fine but at RM19 little better except in presentation than you could get form your local kopitam. The Salmon Nicoise was good but far too much in quantity for a first course – more like a main. The scallops were good and nicely presented. The main course we chose were squid ink pasta - good but a small portion for a main course, King fish which was good and lamb-shank pie which was ordinary and completely overwhelming the pea- based sauce accompanying it. Nothing was poor but there was no “wow, this is good’ feeling which we had hoped for,. nosense that you eating something special. Service was correct, that is, unlike some fine dining restaurants in KL the dishes were served in the correct order and in a synchronised manner. However it was not especially attentive. The overall dining experience is not helped by the poor ambience, for this class of restaurant can they not at least use tablecloths instead of bare table tops. Overall we felt that this was a rather ordinary restaurant masquerading as something special and with a total bill for three of us (including one carafe of the house wine) of RM650 it should have been something special!Show less",3,Reviewed 29 January 2014 ,Bistro a Table

The restaurant did not even have a noticeable sign board , we took sometime to find the place as it was dark around. Since reservation was a must, we booked through the phone, and a waiter led us to the table. We were then given a menu with not much choices, we ordered duck ravioli $68) and canelloni ($82) with a salad that turned out to be good . for desert, choc fondant was worth a try but not the alcoholic cendol, even though it was well presented, I think price is too high.

MissG12Selangor,Best food in town!,"We have just returned from Bistro a table and I can't help but noticed how distort some of the reviews here are of the restaurant.Bistro a table is by far one of the best served food in malaysia. Hubby and I made our way there for our anniversary and it did not disappoint us.The 1st impression, its hidden in a small housing area. (but this makes parking very easy!). As you enter, the smell of lilies struck us by surprise. Very very nice touch. Not many restaurants do this. And the floating orchids, drapes & interesting light decor were definitely a sight to feast on. We had the egg-y entree which many tables were having. Interesting & unique, creamy, sweet and salty at the same time.The mains: I had the rack of lamb which was absolutely amazing. The medium rare meat was succulent & tender. The spices well blended with the meat & the side sauce gave it a nice finishing touch. Hubby had the 12 hour duck. We were toying on fine line as not many places can make a good dish out of duck meat. Presentation wasn't amazing, but the taste was to die for. The meat for soft & tender. Nice!We could not decide on the dessert as they all sounded unique and delicious. Hubby said many recommended the guava tart with ice cream. It was an interesting combination of 3 S: sweet, soury, and savoury. AmazinglY delicious! Usually, I don't fancy chocolate brownies too much as it can be too rich towards the end. But the addition of pomelo was a nice touch.I couldn't stop myself from ordering the same (VERY INTERESTING) dessert as the table next to ours, Chocolate brownie with pomelo and espresso liquor. It came as a choco powdered sphere/ball. And as the waiter poured the espresso liquor, the sphere crumbled wherever the liquor touched. Leaving the chcolate fudge brownie immersed in liquor.. Very interesting.Will i go back again? Yes! For special occasions (as it is a little pricey, but I dont mind spending on occasions). Will I recommend my friend, or the next reader? Yes!! It is a must visit! Go with an open mind, it mught be a lil $$$, but the place caters too all the senses. Taste, sight, and smell. Amazing visit here tonight.

Service was moderate too as most staff are immigrants from neighboring countries hence communication is moderated but communicable. But given the recommendations as Japanese fine dining, i guess I m expecting more. I ordered a sukiyaki. The beef served was fresh but not top quality as claimed. Half way through the meal, to my horror I found myself chewing through a cooked plastic piece hiding in between the vegetable fished out from the sukiyaki.As I was highlighting the issue to the staff who as confused as I am, resulting a feeling of ""should i complete my meal to satisfy my craving"" or ""should i pay and leave""After 10 mins,the staff told me that chef explanation is the plastic is from the beef wrapper and that I don't have to pay for my meal. I thank him for the explanation but end of the day is not that we don't have to pay. Is that you acknowledge the mistake made. Feeling confused I just left abruptly. No one bother to apologies.

Strange considering that I lived in homes situated along Old Klang Road for most of my childhood until early adulthood, I've never been to IshinLet's start with good stuff :-Excellent presentation especially for the kaiseki which can rival the top restaurants in the city. The igloo that housed the sashimi was a nice touch. The kids loved itFreshness - which is arguably the key to Japanese food was great . In particular the sashimi Kampachi was fantastic (although no toro or even maguro was included in the sashimi course, a little disappointed ) Price - although not cheap but will not empty your wallet . For the quality , it was deemed reasonable Bad stuffCleanliness - the exterior and the front part of the dining area was impressive but however as we were given a private room, we have to go behind and up a narrow staircase near the kitchen. The area around the staircase was untidy and dirty . The management should try to keep the area cleaner and a fresh coat of paint or wallpaper won't hurt either .Cooking - the quality of the cooking was uneven With the sashimi, tempura and agemono being handled with good skills. The yakimono was unacceptable , fried rice was tasteless , the teppanyaki beef not seasoned and tough and the grilled fish also not up to usual standard.On the whole, the experience was not unpleasant as service was good and price was not exorbitant but to claim to be a fine dining restaurant , I think all various sections of the kitchen should be of equal levels and not subject the patrons to possible hits and misses depending on what dishes they ordered Show less",3,Reviewed 29 June 2016 ,Ishin Japanese Dining

noisyminor,A lovely place for good Japanese food,"Before we discovered Sasagawa in Sharaton Imperial Hotel, this was the place we would go for good (above average) Japanese cuisine in KL, especially for its most delicious grilled tina jaw. (Order this first as it takes a long time to prepare.) We prefer its a la carte menu over the sets. (We have never order any sets as we looked at other diners' tables and thought sets were just cheaper and faster alternatives to satisfy office workers nearby.) I am not sure of the quality do please don't quote my words.However, if you order individual dishes, you should be quite happy with its offerings. Also, if you don't mind footing out a bit more, its omakase (chef's choice menu) will blow your mind as that is how it's done in its homeland. Parking is an issue here since it is a small bungalow located on a narrow street off a major road. Fortunately, the restaurant has come up a solution with valet parking so it has not been a problem for us. If you have a group of 4 and above, please do reserves seats first as it fills up quickly.

Both Chef were super friendly and attentive. Their food presentation is kind of cool and creative too. It was cool when the Chefs surprised me during my visits. They can pull it off and deliver extremely yummy treats. Just talk to them nicely. One should give a try at their evening aperitif.

"idrus2015Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",FIRST ONLINE ORDER,"Every Ramadan, we decided to eat simple, content with pasar malam takeaways, and never allowing a full meal to affect the blessed month of fasting and praying. But the last day of fasting was always at Paya Serai as there was no rush to go for terawih prayers and we indulged after a month of abstinence.But 2020 was a challenge due to the MCO and we thought we had to forgo this experience. But no, PJH offered online orders of different menus during Ramadan and Syawal, and we ordered one set after the 6 days of puasa enam ie Ramadan and Syawal fasting obligations over!And my what a set it was. Priced at slightly above rm300, we got the following Hari Raya delicacies: nasi briani with ayam panggang percik,dendeng, mutton briani, sweet sour fish, sambal prawn and vegetables, laksa johor, lontong, ketupat and lemang with rendang and serunding chicken and beef, murtabak ayam plus desserts of french pastries, pineapple tart, bread and butter pudding and kuih raya. It was meant for five people and there were only four of us. So with the help of the freezer, we stretched out the meal over three days!Best dish? All voted for the scrumptious laksa johor, but the rest of the food was great tasting as well. it was a bargain as we did not have to finish everything in one sitting but we were also mindful of the advisory attached to the Hilton bag regarding duration of keeping the food fresh and consumable.Paya Serai, you outdid yourself and kudos to the Chefs, it was a fantastic gastronomic journey that reminded us that Hilton delivers, even in trying times.

The lady in lime green attire who ushered us to our table was unfriendly and cold. And, she informed us that the buffet was not ready and she walked off.Then, we ventured inside (she had given us a table outside the main dining area) and the guy in chef attire was really friendly and said: 'welcome!' and he said we could start eating. So we went for a look around. And, we took our food. Then, while walking around, we saw the mean lady in lime green who looked angrily at us and reprimanded us: 'I told you the buffet was not ready!!!'Did she think she was the headmistress reprimanding students?So I laughingly informed her that the chef said we could start eating and she just walked off angrily, ignoring us.At the end of our lunch, we had to encounter the mean lime green lady again at the cashier counter and she gave our table number to one nice lady in black and just pointed us to 'go there'.She is really the rudest person I have ever met in PJ Hilton. Is this really the way to treat customers?Other than this rude person, we did enjoy the spread of Malaysian Hawker food. The fried chempedak was the best we have ever eaten.

"SuSankar1999Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Christmas eve buffet dinner- a letdown,"Recently, a friend and i went for the much hyped Christmas Eve buffet dinner at Paya Serai in PJ Hilton. I used to come here a lot a few years ago due to the selection and great tasting food. Unfortunately, the reputation has taken a severe beating in my opinion. The food selection was poor and limited. While they had the usual turkey and the trimmings (which to be fair, was nicely done) the rest of fare was quite disappointing. The taste of some of the dishes was surprisingly bad with some par ingredients. When some of the dishes ran out, it was not replenished. For a buffet service, it doesn't make sense to not replenish an item that was finished an hour and a half before the buffet closes. The dessert counter was quite pathetic and those that were served could have been given more attention during preparation. All in all, the whole thing was a waste of money. Would not recommend it again. On the plus side, The few staffs that were around, were very friendly and kind. But having said that, they were too few people working the tables. We even talked to other patrons who were trying to get someone to clear the plates and replenish water and there was only 1-2 staffs doing that.

It's not that it's bad-it just isn't great and for the name and the price that's not really good enough. On entering the buffet it looks like there's a lot on offer. However, once you've been around a couple of times, you start struggling. The dishes all have a certain blandness that is fairly typical of major hotels in KL. As all locals and residents know even the cheapest roadside stall will give you tastier local food. The international sections are also a bit disappointing. They look appetizing up to a point, but taste-wise there's always something missing. Might as well pop into Uncle Chillis for some western food with a bit of oomph!So, as usual our large group left wondering why we'd done it to ourselves again.

"lalalyzzPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",A Let Down,"My family and I were here earlier for their iftar/ dinner buffet. Well. Now. I have a lot to say. First: The crowd: Glutton and I must say, almost barbaric. It was as if they couldn't grasp the concept of attending a buffet. There was no system and everywhere I looked the place was nothing but an eye sore. Kids were minging everywhere. Second: Foods were not replenished immediately. The guests had completely emptied some of the dishes 10 minutes into the buffet. Third: Plates were only available at 2 sections. At one point I wanted to get hold of some lamb curry that was located near the cashier. I had to hustle through the crowd all the way to the back to get a plate. I don't mind the wait & the walk. But like I mentioned earlier, the crowd could easily get on your nerves. Fourth: Plates, glasses & cutleries had stains on them. Also. When we arrived, we were short of cutleries & napkins. Fifth: most of the servers ignored us. There was a nice Nepalese lad, Deniya, the only one who never failed to attend to us. Sixth: when I asked the staff where to get certain dishes, they didn't know which was which and were just as completely lost as I was. Seventh: Upon payment, we were asked how many of us showed up. (We initially booked a second table for our dear Mom and her friends. We cancelled it before the buffet since the crowd was inappropriate for a reunion. They had their dinner at Genji, a Japanese restaurant on the first floor). When we said 3 (only my sister, myself, and my brother were evidently present), the cashier, Azuna or something, snickered and condescendingly asked ""3..? Really? Are you sure? 3 of you?"". To each of that we nicely answered yes and nodded harder than a bobblehead. I wasn't having it. I went, ""Don't you believe us? Don't you need to have trust in your customers should you wish to earn it from them?""She did apologise afterwards when she gave us our change. We didn't leave our tip there. We tipped the servers in person. And so should you. Eighth: Food: I wish I didn't have to do this. But honestly, it's merely decent here. Nothing was good. If you're looking for a traditional cuisine be it Indian, Malay, Chinese, it's not worth it. Ninth: Cleanliness:The worst part was the arrangement. Floor & food stations were dirty, there were food bits and spills everywhere. Utensils were oily and disgusting. Again this reflects back on the customers as well. Drinking glasses were placed upward (unhygienic). There were plenty of used glasses amongst the clean ones. Again, the crowd. Tenth: buffet for 3 was RM 357. I don't think it should be that expensive given the food quality & service weren't up to our expectation. Eleventh: Parking basement: Looks sketchy. A complete maze. If you have thyroid and failing eyes like me, you're not gonna enjoy circling around the narrow maze. The building is basically just old and hasn't been renovated.Our huge car couldn't manoeuvre around certain corners. (We are fatties. Hence the cruiser)Twelfth: Parking is expensive here. RM 18 per entry. Everyone was given an RM 8 discount. Nice gesture. But looking at the parking bay, you'll be blown away. Some were upset to find out the parking fee. They had that 'yong soi' (black face) look on them. Despite everything I've mentioned, I was here a few times years ago. The last was 2 years ago. Buffet was better then. Maybe à la carte's better here. Who knows. I'm not gonna give it a try.Show less",1,Reviewed 4 July 2016 ,Paya Serai

tkzrea,Not as great as what it used to be,"I do come to this restaurant quite often, previously for business lunches but now usually for a business drinks only. Sometimes I have the family here to dine for their buffet here which has been almost an well known attraction of this restaurant for many years (I am talking about at least 20 years). Up until recently, I have always thought the food was above par but now I have come to believe that it is now just average in taste, especially when one considers the prices they charge being a restaurant in a five star hotel i.e. The Hilton. The standards and taste have dwindled over the years and as a regular patron, you come to realize this quite quickly. In fact, whilst having to relax at the lounge recently, I decided to ask for on the menu pepperoni pizza and what they served me was a small plain pizza topped with sliced frankfurters. I don't think this should come from a 5-star hotel.Nevertheless, I must say the ambience is still cozy, despite having a lobby that is usually filled with people. The service provided by the staff there is also very good. Unfortunately, there are times you get smokers in the lounge which is located in front of the restaurant. For some reason, the management do not discourage them from smoking, but to be fair, this occurrence appears to be lesser now. On the overall, this restaurant and the lounge in front of it do provide services which is of acceptable standards. I would probably patronize the lounge again as it is a very convenient place to have a business discussion; given the nice set up. However, this may not be enough to persuade me to bring my guests or family for a meal any longer since the quality of the cuisines and the presentation have not kept up with present standards. One must consider that there are many other restaurants to choose from in that area given the prices this restaurant charges, and unless the management does something to improve it, I am afraid their patrons will be limited to mainly their hotel guests; which may not be aware of the presence of nearby restaurants.Show less",3,Reviewed 21 December 2015 ,Paya Serai

Each section had about 3-4 dishes except for starters and dessert which had more. Food was not bad -- could have been better considering the small number of dishes available. Drinks are served at the table. Tea/coffee is part of buffet.A sore point was some dishes were not placed as per labels. e.g. Label says Malay Kuih but options were definitely not Malay Kuih. In fact assorted Malay kuih were placed behind the chocolate fountain (opposite side of the table), giving you the impression it is part of the chocolate fountain fare.Also I felt one or two dishes could have been categorized better (e.g. Chicken soup with Chinese herbs placed under Malay section as well as lamb soup commonly found in Mamak outlets).Show less",3,Reviewed 11 December 2015 ,Paya Serai

We arrived 15 minutes early for their weekend high tea buffet which starts at 12.30pm. There was no one manning the entrance, so I walked in to find someone. There were plenty of waitress and kitchen staff walking around but no one bothered to greet and ask for your reservation or seat you down. Few other guests were also walking around waiting to catch the attention of someone to direct them to their tables. Finally I approched a waitress who lead me to my reserved table. Once seated, you are left alone, they don't ask if you'd like iced water, nor automatically bring you iced water (unlike other hotels). 30 minutes into our meal we were still not served any water, and my husband had to flag a waiter down to ask for water for the table. Tables were slow to be cleared, even when there were at least 3 servers at our section. So we just stacked our dirty plates on top of each other. The buffet spread was mediocre. Not much choices and mediocre in quality. There was no seafood section at all, no oysters, prawns, crabs, scallops, mussels on ice etc....there was no japanese or italian section either. The chinese food was very disappointing, the Malay section was the best among all. Dessert ice cream was terrible. They only served those cheap local ice cream in chocolate, strawberry and yam flavour. Do not expect premium gelato quality ice cream here. Surprised a 5 star Hilton hotel serves this kind of ice cream... Shangrila and Mandarin Oriental all serve premium gelato quality ice creams at their buffets.Lastly, parking is super expensive here. We parked for less than 2 hours, and it was RM15. When settling the bill, we gave our parking tickets for validation, but the waiter said it's a flat rate today (Saturday), so no validation is necessary. I think RM15 flat rate for 1 hour plus of parking is ridiculous. We had 2 cars at our table so the parking fee was RM30, which in my opinion is very expensive. Even parking in hotels in the middle of KL city is much cheaper, normally around RM8 for 2 hours of parking, their restaurant dining flat rates are also around RM8, certainly not RM15.Conclusion, poor service, mediocre food, and expensive parking... do not waste your time here.Show less",1,Reviewed 17 August 2013 ,Paya Serai

"ann cKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Impressive,"Have been to this place many times for both dinner & lunch, casual & business, and this restaurant have not failed me thus far. Good service with very impressive dishes. Since it's a business lunch, I thought it rude to take pics of the food items, therefore no photos except for the dessert when my guest was away @ the powder room! We were sharing 5 dishes - Unagi maki, teppanyaki enoki mushrooms, Salmon trio, crispy salmon skin salad, saba shioyaki & dessert with coffee. My favourite was the Salmon trio that came in 2 variety (regular & belly) done 3 ways - sushi, maki & sashimi .. excellent!! It was fresh & generously thick, 4 pieces of each types. Ended the meal with a popular Japanese dessert, dorayaki (Doraemon's favourite) and coffee. Overall a very satisfying meal with the total bill amounting to RM395. This outlet is the most up-market among it's group of restaurants, so 5 star dishes with a matching price to go with it.Show less",4,Reviewed 1 May 2021 ,Kampachi Plaza33

geegee-pei,Overrated and lousy weekend lunch buffet. Overpriced and below par food served,"Went there last Sunday for their weekend lunch buffet for rm148. I was there couple weeks ago for business lunch and it was good and subsequently recommended by the manager -Edward to try out the weekend lunch,boasting slipper lobster and snow crab for the price of rm148 per month. What a disappointment! Although it's a buffet spread, given the price, the restaurant ought to prepare more fresh food for the customers. Lobster and snow crab was not fresh and so dry. None of us enjoy it at All! Ordered medium done teppanyaki beef and the meat was tough. The teppanyaki salmon was so dry and we couldn't eat it at all. Basic food ie fried food such as tempurara was equally bad. Over fried. Even the fruits - watermelon, grapes and honey dew were not fresh and some of the grapes had turned sour! The only thing that was edible was the unagi,sukiyaki. For the piece I've paid to bring the whole family there (spent rm610; bear in mind rm148 buffet doesn't include green tea which they charged additional rm6 per pax),i could have a way better and decent Japanese meal elsewhere. I will not visit again. In fact, given the obvious double standard and extreme food quality served during ala Carte and buffet,I will not patronize even for ala carte meals as I've felt totally cheated.Note :didn't even bother taking much pics of the food since it was not worth remembering.Show less",1,Reviewed 22 May 2019 ,Kampachi Plaza33

341angelinesMalaysia,Sunday lunch buffet,"I have dined in this restaurant several times (at least 4-5 times this year) for their Sunday lunch buffet, and I have several comments:PROS:1. Firstly, great food. No complaints in regards to the freshness of the sashimi. Variety of food is good, so for some who don't fancy raw foods, the cooked foods section is more than adequate to please. Although from my experience the tempura prawns or the miso halibut seem to run out pretty quickly, it is quite quickly restocked.2. Making reservation is highly recommended as I have seen this restaurant when it's full-house. It does get pretty busy on some SundaysCONS:I absolutely hated sitting at the ""bird's nest"" seats near the entrance. During my last 2 visits to the restaurant, I was given those seats, much to my frustration. When I first sat there, I immediately noticed that the air-conditioning was bad at that section and I started sweating even before the meal. I wanted to request to change tables immediately, but of course, no waiters were allocated to take care of the section. Instead, most waiters were posted at the inner main seating area. Waving at waiters who were all standing so far away didn't worked. Hence, after a few minutes of frustration, I walked to the entrance to speak to the staff for a table change. I was told the ""bird's nest"" seats were for small groups and that the main area is only for large families (not true, by the way. I previously sat in the main seating area even though it was just me and my fiance). As I didn't want to make a fuss, I attempted to settle down at that miserable section. When I was finally ready to order a pot of tea, again my attempts at gaining the attention of the waiters failed. Due to the design of the seats & table, it was hard for waiters to see my waving hands; and of course all the waiters were at the main seating area. Again, I had to get up and walk to the main entrance to tell the staff that I want to order tea, and again, I requested to change tables because this is just ridiculous. Again, I was refused. As a consolation, I was given a buzzer-type device so that I can call for the waiter. During that same visit, I saw other patrons who sat at the same section getting frustrated too with the lack of attention from waiters. One family even took their pile of dirty plates and placed it directly at the bar counter as their table was not cleared.As for my most recent visit on 29th July 2018, I immediately requested for a table at the main area after being led to this awful section. My request was denied. This time, I immediately told the waitress I want the buzzer device as I don't see any waiters in this section of the restaurant. Anyway, the area was still hot with weak air-conditioning. But what made me really irritated was when I saw several other tables in the main seating area with 2 patrons only. How is it that some patrons get to sit in the more comfortable main area, and my requests for table-change was denied in 2 visits? These past 2 experiences were truly awful, but only because I had to eat while being sweaty and getting irritated from the lack of attention from staff.Over all, my biggest advice is to go there for the food only. Service and seating-wise, they are subjective and depends on your luck. Obviously, ambience is totally 0% if you have the misfortune of being seated near the entrance (Imagine being sweaty and waving your hands around like a monkey just to get the waiters' attention, which was what I did).Show less",3,Reviewed 4 August 2018 ,Kampachi Plaza33

Unfortunately, I ended up ordering the wrong thing - I wished it could have been explained and I ended up with a really small miserable piece of fish.

Food was good however the service was so so which made my business lunch...disappointed!Here's what happened on 20 June 2019:1. I called about 1130am to make a reservation. I was told to call back at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be taken when the restaurant opens. Hello...this is a 5 star hotel! 2. I contacted one of the managers at the hotel and she was kind enough to help make the reservation. Since this was a business lunch, I want to be prepared. The reservation was made. 3. When we walked into the restaurant at 1210pm, two staff were at the front and some at the Sushi bar. None of them greeted us. I have to inform them I have made a reservation. I thought the restaurant opens at 12pm! 4. I asked the waitress what was the Gunkan promotion, the colorful menu was on the table. The waitress said she doesn't know. Omg! 5. My business partner got his California Temaki, then his Gindara set. But...Where's my Sashimi set??? I asked the waitress..Then...3rd came the Gunkan. I have to ask again and again when was my Sashimi set since my other guest has already halfway into his Gindara set. It's about 15min later I got my Sashimi set. I think Miyabi has coordination issue, it's out of sync. Furthermore, the waitress need to be trained to be able to answer questions about the menu.

Yes. It was. This recent Saturday dinner reflected contemporary Japanese dishes (ryōri) was filled with friends' sharing enjoyment, food elegance and ambience (all about 雅).Last not the least, the stone-grilled Wayu, stone-grilled chef specail seafood, and the Omakase soup, which did high-light this fabulous evening and dining.MIYABI do span a wide spectrum from friend/family dining rather than the intricate Kaiseki ryōri (懐石料理).Salute to you to bring in this different MIYABI reflect from Chefs and high attentive serving staffs.Show less",5,Reviewed 15 April 2019 ,Miyabi

Upon walking in,the ambience was good and quiet. There were many beautiful Japanese decorations in place. We noticed the restaurant was only minimally occupied with 4-5 tables of patrons. Overall the fresh sashimi and sushi were good and generously sized. However the service was very much lacking. We were attended to by friendly,courteous but inexperienced staff needing to improve on efficiency. Food took an hour to arrive. And the last dish of a simple garlic fried rice arrived 1 1/2 hours after the order. Upon inquiring with different staff on the reason of delay,all they said was that they’ll check on it. There was no follow up on the progress of orders. One of our chicken teppanyaki dishes arrived cold,giving the impression that it had already been cooked and left out on the counter for quite awhile.

Josephyeong88,Service was so so...,"The highly rated Miyabi restaurant at the Sheraton PJ needs to improve the service. Food was good however the service was so so which made my business lunch...disappointed!Here's what happened on 20 June 2019:1. I called about 1130am to make a reservation. I was told to call back at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be taken when the restaurant opens. Hello...this is a 5 star hotel! 2. I contacted one of the managers at the hotel and she was kind enough to help make the reservation. Since this was a business lunch, I want to be prepared. The reservation was made. 3. When we walked into the restaurant at 1210pm, two staff were at the front and some at the Sushi bar. None of them greeted us. I have to inform them I have made a reservation. I thought the restaurant opens at 12pm! 4. I asked the waitress what was the Gunkan promotion, the colorful menu was on the table. The waitress said she doesn't know. Omg! 5. My business partner got his California Temaki, then his Gindara set. But...Where's my Sashimi set??? I asked the waitress..Then...3rd came the Gunkan. I have to ask again and again when was my Sashimi set since my other guest has already halfway into his Gindara set. It's about 15min later I got my Sashimi set. I think Miyabi has coordination issue, it's out of sync. Furthermore, the waitress need to be trained to be able to answer questions about the menu. How can she not know the items on promotion!I love the Sheraton PJ where every employee is so friendly. Miyabi was my first disappointment. I hope the service will be improved soon!

"CCBTSEHong Kong, China",Contemporary Reflect of MIYABI,"Contemporary Reflect of MIYABI“Miyabi” (雅) name is quite commonly adapted by business entrepreneurs. I’d reminiscence across family-own coffee shops, restaurants to even home stays. Visited and came across few during trips.Obviously it is intended to reflect their noble wishes to fuse Elegance, Comfort and challenges to mark customer satisfaction.Acquainted with “Yue” managers, the sister restaurant nearby, we grouped few friends to sample “MIYABI” at PJ Sheraton Hotel.We started to explore this first time visited via ambience and menu.Flipped through menu, did see a down-to-earth “easy” menu, and could understand PJ Sheraton MIYABI veers to conceptual direction of relax (雅) rather than the intricate Kaiseki or Zen ryōri (懐石料理) which certain highly branded Hotel adapts to.Through chats with Chef Dino and Chef Yau, we decided to ask them favour of a non-menu “Omakase” journey to sample the reflect of MIYABI.Sashimi, maki roll, tempura ……sounds ordinary, right? Yes. It was. This recent Saturday dinner reflected contemporary Japanese dishes (ryōri) was filled with friends' sharing enjoyment, food elegance and ambience (all about 雅).Last not the least, the stone-grilled Wayu, stone-grilled chef specail seafood, and the Omakase soup, which did high-light this fabulous evening and dining.MIYABI do span a wide spectrum from friend/family dining rather than the intricate Kaiseki ryōri (懐石料理).Salute to you to bring in this different MIYABI reflect from Chefs and high attentive serving staffs.Show less",5,Reviewed 15 April 2019 ,Miyabi

And the last dish of a simple garlic fried rice arrived 1 1/2 hours after the order. Upon inquiring with different staff on the reason of delay,all they said was that they’ll check on it.
