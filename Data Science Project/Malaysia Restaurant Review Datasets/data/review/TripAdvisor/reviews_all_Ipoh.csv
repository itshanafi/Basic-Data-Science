"AgentcikayKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Fantastic International Cuisine at Cuisines,"Dinner here at Cuisines Restaurant was good. The dishes were well cooked, and whilst flavourful were low is sodium. Apparently no MSG is used in the cooking which is great especially for children. We had an excellent Ipoh Curry Noodles, Thai beef salad served with Miang Kham - Wild Betel Leaf Wrap and Hainanese Chicken rice on the Asian menu which was thoroughly delicious.¬†From the Western menu, the Fish and Chips left a lasting impression - the batter was nice and crispy and the fish succulent.¬†In the mornings, we had the buffet breakfast at Cuisines again - no complaints what so ever and our kiddo loved the eggs made sunny side up!¬†The service personal we charming, well mannered and efficient. All in all a great time for the family!Show less",5,Reviewed 3 weeks ago ,Cuisines Restaurant

"edwinkhoosekhIpoh, Malaysia",Birthday dinner,"I eat here regularly. Most time the food is excellent and good ingredients especially by evening crews. My only negative experience was the beef cheese burger. (The beef patty sometimes overcooked). Due to mco, I suspect takeaway is not as tasty as dining in the restaurant while food still warm. I went to celebrate my birthday in Haven recently when dine in allowed. I love the food and the attention they give to us. Birthday set (one day booking in advance) is so good and value for money. I can't think of any other restaurant that could offer such a good birthday package and nice ambience/scene to enjoy with my family. The food quality is so good esp prawn salad. The mousse is yummy. Best of all being in outdoor concept surrounded by jungle is so fittingly safer during pandemic. Fresh air, attentive service and not crowded. I love it.

"Darren_JellyGeorge Town, Malaysia",„ÄêThe Heavenly Haven„Äë,"With all the buzz around The Haven All Suite Resort, Ipoh, we had always longed for a staycation there. And we are so glad we visited, definitely worth the reviews.Check-in was a breeze. The front office was kind enough not only to give a free room upgrade but also to decorate the bed and cooperate with me to surprise my wife. The cozy and spacious suite consists of full kitchenette, sofa, dining area, bathtub (a little small). Shower pressure can be better though. Not to mention, it comes with a spectacular view overlooking the iconic limestone, forests and lakes. With the Haven's natural environment, nocturnal chorus of singing insects will get you into deep sleep and you will wake up to the sound of the birds chirping the next morning. The resort is well-equipped with facilities like round-lake jogging track, trademark swimming pool, gym, sport courts, pet's corner (well-taken care of) etc. It is just a pity the pool was closed due to MCO during our stay.There is another hidden gem here - the Cuisines Restaurant, which proudly proclaims the use of only the finest ingredients without artificial nonsense as the cornerstone. It is not an exaggeration, I will give them that. We came here for the sumptuous 6-course romantic candle light dinner by the lake, expecting small portions but boy, we were wrong. Not only generous in portion, the food was delicious. We also ordered a small Fresh Fruit Yee Sang and it was scrumptious, like no other we have tasted. Jeet, a young lad, was our waiter and we had excellent service. He was very friendly, prompt and always there to check on us. I can see that he was very conscientious about providing good service and customer satisfaction. In conclusion: wonderful dinner, great service, amazing ambiance and breathtaking view of the lake and mountains! In fact, the food was so good we went back for lunch the next day too. The breakfast included was nothing to shout about though. You should try their homemade The Haven Welcome Drink, it was so refreshing and rejuvenating.We will come back for sure, to have a meal and to take a dip in the infinity pool.

They clearly take pride in doing a good job and enjoy interacting with guests. Our waiter Jeet did an excellent job of keeping us served with food and drinks, and was a friendly and interesting man to chat to.We were staying in the hotel on the full board package, which has a special menu where you get a main course, fruit juice and a few pieces of cut fruit and sometimes a small piece of cake. This was fine for us but wouldn't suit someone who wanted full 3 course meals. There is a good range of meat and fish dishes on the menu (around 15-20 options), both western and Asian. The portions were substantial and my husband really enjoyed all of the meals he had. As a vegetarian, I was less impressed with the menu - though there were 4 vegetarian options, which was good, they were not very interesting compared with the non-veggie options that were on offer. Egg sandwich, fried noodles, fried rice or spaghetti aglio olio - they were all tasty, but it was quite monotonous after a couple of meals as apart from the sandwich it was basically all just a carbohydrate fried with some vegetables - not even any protein such as tofu. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian recipes out there, so I'd suggest a bit more imagination when planning these options.

The birthday cake was prepared as per my request with candle and birthday greetings. The ambience of the restaurant was very pleasant and the scenery was breathtaking although the lighting was dim towards the mountain. Perhaps a bit more additional lighting could be added. There were no mosquitoes although we were surrounded by nature and that adds another speciality to the restaurant. The pricing was very reasonable compared to other high end eateries in Ipoh. One improvement they could do is to brighten the pathway from the main entrance (guard house) to the lobby / parking area and the guard could guide us to the parking area or maybe a better signage to visitors.

Service was good.Taking into account price, environment and menu, it is a big surprise to me that it is rated as one of the top restaurant in Ipoh.

The atmosphere is pleasant and like other reviews said the staff are friendly and efficient. Sadly we were very disappointed by the food. For starter we ordered the humous with pita bread. The bread was industrially made and dry. The humous itself was ok but less tasty as those we enjoy in Arabic restaurants of Bukit Bintang area in KL. I ordered the fillet mignon steak. First of all the fillet mignon quality was changed to ribeye. Clearly the meat had been frozen. I requested medium rare cooking and oit came out very well done, hard and tasteless. The cut was thin like basic local steaks from buffalo meat. The sauce was made from powder and so was the tiny mash portion. My wife ordered the lamb. It was presented exactly the same way with industrially made mash, powder sauce and a few vegetable. We had only mineral water to drink and out total bill was RM 180. Clearly way too expensive for the quality offered. Sadly, not a place to recommend in Ipoh and way over rated here on Tripadvisor.Show less",2,Reviewed 29 November 2019 ,Cuisines Restaurant

On arrival at the restaurant the outside dining area was definitely not full, and during our stay there were only 2 tables occupied. This didn‚Äôt make us feel very welcome. Anyway, we went inside and ordered food. We ordered chicken rice without seafood and got chicken rice with seafood. My curry mee was without egg and tofu while description said it had egg and tofu.

Their laksa selection is also top notch. My favourite is the Singapore Laksa. Pasta lovers will love the pastas here too as we really enjoyed the aglio olio as well as carbonara pasta.

All were delightful and pleasing especially the soup, the steak was of good quality beef with no hint of gristle; my only complaint was the pesto sauce was somewhat on the heavy side. However, any mild deficiency was made up with by the quiet intimate ambience, and most definitely the excellent and personal service by Jony and his colleagues. My friend celebrated her birthday that night, and we were blessed with a slice of complimentary cheesecake for dessert, in addition to the brownie we had ordered.. all prettily dressed up with fruits, wording and a candle.

toyssamurai,Will fly from USA to Ipoh just for Yuk Sou Hin's Signature Smoked Duck,"If you are like me, who has seen/tasted the golden age of Hong Kong's Cantonese cuisine, you must have heard that Ipoh in Malaysia is the perfect place to reconnect to the lost taste of Hong Kong's best foods (yes, unfortunately, the foods in Hong Kong are no longer as good as before). Many locals would swear that Ming Court Hong Kong Dim Sum (ÊòéÈñ£È¶ôÊ∏ØÈªûÂøÉ) is the best Cantonese restaurant in Ipoh, while some tourists would say that Foh San Restaurant (ÂØåÂ±±Ëå∂Ê®ì) is better, but I am going to tell you that Yuk Sou Hin at Weil Hotel (ÁéâÂ£ΩËªí) is the ultimate Cantonese in Ipoh. In my recent trip to Ipoh, I have tried all three Cantonese restaurants mentioned above, and while Ming Court did retain the old Hong Kong dim sum style, it is a restaurant that operates entirely in 70s style. In another word, it's dirty, messy and crowded. If its foods are really that good, I would be willing to ignore all those shortcomings. Unfortunately, while its foods are good, they are not that good. Foh San (ÂØåÂ±±) fares slightly better. If Ming Court is from the 70s, Foh San is from the 80s. However, locals usually trashed their foods, but they probably just dislike that Foh San is slightly more expensive than Ming Court. Some of the dim sum made by Foh San is a lot better than Ming Court. For example, the È¶¨ÊãâÁ≥ï from Foh San is lightyear ahead of Ming Court. Neither restaurant could compare to Yuk Sou Hin, however. Yuk Sou Hin is a Cantonese restaurant of the current age, but retains the delicious foods from the golden age of Hong Kong cuisine. The shrimp in the har gow (Ëù¶È§É) is fresh and big, the skin is thin and transparent. Their shumai (Siew Mai) does not use pork, but you would never find it a problem. But what you really should try is their BBQ style of Skewered Siew Mai. They managed to keep the delicious taste of traditional Siew Mai, while giving it a different interpretation. But, what you really must try at Yuk Sou Hin is its ""Signature Smoked Duck with Lychee Wood"" (ÊãõÁâåËå∂ËëâËçîÊûùÊú®ÁÉ§ÁáªÈ¥®). It's one of the best duck I have ever put into my mouth. In fact, I would say that there're two things in Ipoh that would make me want to fly all the way from USA, just to eat them. This duck from Yuk Sou Hin and the DouhuaÔºàË±ÜËÖêËä±Ôºâfrom Funny Mountain Soya Beancurd (Â•áÂ≥∞Ë±ÜËä±).Even if you don't stay in Weil Hotel, make sure you visit Yuk Sou Hin during your trip to Ipoh.Show less",5,Reviewed 16 February 2020 ,Yuk Sou Hin

"Yasmin ESingapore, Singapore",Halal Dim Sum,"Really good Halal Dim Sum in Ipoh. The Best Duck dish on Earth. We are duck lovers, so if duck is on the menu, never will it not be on our table. We ""hunt"" for it wherever we land. It was Yuk Sou Hin's duck after all that brought us to Weil hotel for brunch. I am not prone to exaggeration, Yuk Sou Hin truly serves up the best, most delectable duck we have ever had. It was fragrant from the lychee wood it was smoked with. Not a single part of it was dry, nor was there even a morsel of tough bit (that in itself is an achievement). My 7 year old girl, decided partway thru the meal, to concentrate mainly on the duck. So a family of 2 adults and 3 children was able to polish off a whole duck without any issues (Thank you Mr. Ron for advising us against the half duck order, Yes, it wouldnt have been enough). It is so good, that it has become the defining point of our Ipoh trip. When asked how the trip was, all any one of us rambled on about, is Yuk Sou Hin's duck. Literally, from the time we landed back home, and I handed over Mr. Ron's (Yuk Sou Hin's Manager) business card to an uncle who is as passionate abt duck as we are, who drives to ghimpoh yearly for a religious trip, to my next trip (which explains the delay for this review), Yuk Sou Hin's duck has taken over my conversations.

Perhaps of the way of my dressing, tee shirt, khaki pants and slippers; or it could be because of the fact we reached a bit late, around 1350ish, not knowing it will be closed at 1430 hours. 2 incidents which totally disgust me. 1) the staffs were quarrelling around our tables. A male manager was scolding a female staff, regarding of her performance of the day. As part of the management, he should well know to deal with this when they are in private, that said, the customer shouldn't hear all these nonsense when they are dining.2) I know you're closing at 1430 hours. My dessert was not served yet, I haven't finished my food yet. The waiter came by my table and asked for me to pay. And when I was reloading my big pay card, he stood there for a good 5 mins (to be fair, the Internet was weak there). I am no waiter, but I don't think that should be the way. If you guys really want us to settle the payment at exactly 1430 before the shift ends, have the courtesy to let us know before we even sit down. I hope the management will review these 2 incidents.

So, I decided that this restaurant would be the perfect restaurant to catch-up with a few old friends whom I haven't seen for a while.We ordered the restaurant's signature Smoked Duck with Lychee Wood, Sauteed Scallop and Prawn with Broccoli, Deep-fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk, Braised Homemade Bean Curd with Shredded Sea Cucumber, Assorted Mushroom and Bamboo Pith, and Seafood Fried Rice with Vegetable Puree and Crisp Rice.All the dishes were very good. One of my friends who is not normally into duck agreed that the restaurant's signature smoked duck really lived up to its reputation as a ""must order"" dish if one is to dine at Yuk Sou Hin. She could not stop eating the flavorful and tender pieces of duck. And this is for someone who is not normally into duck.At the end of the meal, all my dining friends agreed that Yuk Sou Hin Chinese Restaurant is a hidden gem of a restaurant, tucked away on Level One of WEIL Hotel, that's worth visiting whenever good Cantonese cuisine springs to mind. We'll definitely be back for more, especially now that the restaurant has introduced Live Seafood into its excellent repertoire of dishes.Throughout the night, the service from the team who was on duty was prompt and attentive, but yet unobtrusive.

"sweetaftonSingapore, Singapore",One of my better Cantonese Meals - highly recommended.,"There were 5 of us, and although small eaters we ordered 5 dishes and a dessert. Since it was lunch, the meal was actually dim sum. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Yuk Sou Hin. The service was excellent and very friendly. Manager Ron assisted in ordering the dishes. Later Chef Alan came out of the kitchen to greet diners. However the prices for some dishes were a bit steep. So I am not sure whether this is high end fine dining or mid range dining.To add to the fun of dining here, we decided to rate the dishes from best to least best. So here goes.Our favourite was the Signature Smoked Duck with Lychee Wood. Manager Ron suggested half a duck since there were only 5 of us. It was well advised. The meat was tender and juicy, and the skin crispy. The plum sauce went well with the duck. (Rm 45).On the menu was Black Truffle Fried ""Yi Meen"", but since one of us is gluten intolerant, we requested for Black Truffle Fried ""Yi Maifun"" and the chef agreed. It also came with extra seafood. We had a medium sized plate and cleaned it. That's how good it was. (Rm 57)Looking for something exotic, we ordered 3 pieces of Deep Fried Prawn Paste Ball Stuffed with Unagi (eel), wrapped in Vermicelli. We cut the prawn balls in half because there were rather huge. Really really good. (Rm 96) Next was Siew Mai, for me usually ordinary, But this was interesting. We ordered 2 plates, and they came with Fish Roe, on skewers. having been steamed then pan fried. (Rm 22) The Snow Mountain, a honey chicken bun, did not go down as well for us. We felt the filling was not as tasty and too sweet. Because the buns were big, we cut them into halves. The plate came with 3 pieces. (Rm 12)To round up the lunch we ordered 2 bowls of Avocado Puree to share. We all agreed this wasn't our favourite. Not enough taste of avocado. (Rm 24) (The baked egg tarts with cheese were not available.) We will definitely come again, for the duck, the truffle maifun, and the eel roll, and of course, the very excellent service.

Finally I had to approach the cashier to enquire if we could just walk in and sit at any table we liked (which is of course not what a 'fine-dining' restaurant should be!). When we needed to order or request for anything, we had to wave our hands many times before any of the wait staff would look our way, After patrons left, tables were left uncleared for some time. Did they call themselves a fine-dining restaurant?? Probably for the business clientele they are, but not to others!Show less",2,Reviewed 19 December 2015 ,Yuk Sou Hin

"mchllooAustralian Capital Territory, Australia",Worth the try,"As usual, before heading out to try the heavily debated Dim Sum in Ipoh, I did some google search and comments that I've seen are mostly of quality of food and service.I couldn't agree more on that because service, at the very beginning was ridiculously bad. My family was served by a young Chinese lady (which she had no name on herself) and definitely wasn't friendly. She looked mad, and when I approached to ask her things, she refused to answer. Asked for another menu chit and I was told by her that ""You could have combined everything you wanted to order into that particular order sheet"". Rude lady, but one waiter known as TC Lee solved everything.Very professional, and I would give him thumbs up for that.When we first came in to the restaurant, we were told that the glutinous rice was unavailable because the chef was in the midst of preparing it. But towards the end, TC Lee still informed us saying it's available now, do you want to give it a try? Despite it being 15 mins close to the last order, Lee made an effort to make his frustrated customers leaving the restaurant happily.Plenty of room for improvement.Show less",3,Reviewed 13 December 2015 ,Yuk Sou Hin
"irene chan ai l... cIpoh, Malaysia",Didn't quite meet our expectations,"We heard so much about this place....how tasty the dim sum is and what a great bargain it is to pay RM28 for an eat-all-you-can dim sum buffet. So we were there with high expectations, only to leave feeling rather disappointed.I wouldn't say the taste is bad, but it's nowhere near the standard of other Ipoh dim sum places. The ambience is nice, of course, but food presentation could be so much better (bearing in mind that this is a fine dining restaurant). The RM28 eat-all-you-can deal limits you to certain dim sum dishes, and the ubiquitous prawn dumpling's out of the question. Makes you feel a little cheated. Some of the staff were also not quite pleasant, giving you the impression that they are not pleased to serve you.Having said all these, it's nice to try it there...but probably it doesn't warrant a return trip.Show less",3,Reviewed 29 November 2015 ,Yuk Sou Hin

Peking duck, nothing special. The mo-mo skin is very different from the traditional ones u find in China/HK, both texture n taste. Salted fish chix pate was a disappointment. Cant taste the salted fish, it's more like a pc of deepfried meat ball, not panfried. Veggie and the fish were good, no complain. Had the redbean fried pancake, it was good. Nowadays seldom find those with redbean stuffings. It was crunchy on the outside, soft melt-in-your-mouth redbean stuffing inside. The sesame on top added the extra fragrant.

"Cal_TheHotelLoverKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Overrated Yum Cha Place in Ipoh,"Why the angry title? Well, my first visit to YSH was good. At that time, we had the ala carte menu. The service was better, the food was better - until I tried their ""All You Can Eat"" menu. I was with a Caucasian friend one Sunday for their dim sum which I recommend my friend to try. The day before, we had very good dim sum somewhere else in Ipoh. So I told my friend about this place where they serve dim sum in a different style. I really like the pan fried Siew Mai idea and it was really good the first time I tried it. The ""all you can eat"" menu includes the mentioned Siew Mai. Don't be fool with the package, everything is different between all you can eat and ala carte here. Not the same with some restaurants I've been to where there are still presentation for their ala carte buffet. Over here, there's no presentation, the taste is different, the service is different when you dine here with the All You Can Eat package, The was a foul taste with the Siew Mai I mentioned, It felt like it was not defrost properly (yeah I bet it was made much earlier and they freeze it). Another to comment was the custard bun, the first time I had it there, the sauce from the bun ooze out when I bite it, this time - it almost felt like only 1/4 of the original sauce is in it and it just tasted bland. The only eatable food on that day was only the glutinous rice. Me myself never even reorder anything from the menu. Also, be remind simple dim sum dish like the fried carrot cake is not available during this time, which is from the ala carte menu. We took this package because we thought it would be a steal for the food I recommend to my friend. But sadly it wasn't, it is probably one of the worst dim sum experience I had. My advice, if you wish to yum Cha here, go for their ala carte menu which is 11am onwards. You'll get better food, better service. Food lovers like me won't mind to pay more for quality food, but if I were to compare between this place and the other we had the day before, we paid more here than the other and the other was really good almost par to Hong Kong dim sum quality.

In fact, it deserves more than 5 stars.Firstly, the ambiance is unbeatable. Set inside a cave, which has somehow been beautifully decorated to enhance the magical setting and to remove all the unpleasantness associated with caves (damp, dark, filled with bats and guano, etc), Jeff's Cellar looks and feels like the private sanctuary of some rich, Dwarven King. (LOTR fans will recall when Legolas visited the Glittering Caves with Gimli, and was left speechless. Jeff's Cellar brings that to mind.)Secondly, the service is superb. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Mr. Dhavin, excellent man, even advised us which angles were the best and took some fantastic photos of us. Thirdly, the food is Just. So. Amazing. Each course was a delightful treat for the palate, bursting with flavour. The main course - hubby and I both picked the wagyu - was the best beef steak we've had, taste wise. My desire to savour each and every bite warred with my impatience to have the next bite.

One has to make reservation to dine here. The menu is fixed but it changes monthly with the flexibility of choosing your main course and dessert.

Lighting was not too dim. Spring water flowing under us and lime stones surrounding us. The cave was decorated so well that i wish all caves are like this! Our menu consists of caviar, lobster, some well crafted dessert. However the attention was most definitely the A5 Wagyu beef!

"ClarchanSingapore, Singapore",Unique dining experience ,"We had a wonderful dinner at Jeff‚Äôs Cellar, a restaurant nestled inside a natural limestone cave.The restaurant does not accept walk in customers. Advanced booking is necessary and you have to pre-select your mains before arrival. The premise is gated and you are only allowed in upon checking your name against the reservation list. The moment we parked our car a staff approached us to offer assistance. His name was Louis from Philippines and he was extremely friendly and offered to guide us to the restaurant, with a little detour to visit the natural hot spring. He helped to take pictures for us suggesting various good backdrops. At the restaurant Thaya a senior executive took over and was also very friendly and helpful. After showing us to the table he took pictures for us in the amazing cave interior with different angles and background, before the other diners arrive. The table was beautifully decorated with flower petals scattered over. The food was impressive too, deserving better ratings than some of the reviews here render. The amuse bouche of caviar on scallop was delicious. The lobster bisque came in a generous portion of soup in a teapot, the balance of which was kept warm over a tea light candle, which I thought was very thoughtful. The foie gras was a little puny, but nonetheless well prepared, with an innovative grape juice reduction served in a squeeze tube. I had the Australian wagyu beef for mains and it was marvelous, nicely crusted on the outside and tender on the inside. They even have different special steak knives from France to choose from. The lack of tea selection was a little let down, restricted to only English breakfast and green tea. With such close proximity to Cameron higlands that produces high quality tea it is rather unforgivable. After dinner Thaya took us on a tour to visit the chairman‚Äôs private cellar, and other caves in the resort. At RM598 nett per head it is not cheap however if you can afford and into fine dining I would strongly recommend you do not miss this unique experience if you are in Ipoh.

Mhttar,Offering doesn't deserve the price,"The cave atmosphere is breathtaking and beautifully lit, which makes this place quite special...but the food is average at best especially when considering the price. From a price to quality perspective, this restaurant would actually rank quite low from my perspective.The staff is attentive, however not knowledgeable about the menu. In such a restaurant which aims to give a michelin star attitude, you would expect a lot of details coming out of the waiters, which was not the case in Jeff's Cellar. Good wine menu, but again noone really there to help with wine pairing.We got the Chairman's set menu, which is 500rm per person. Amuse bouche and the lobster soup were both weak and nothing special, very small portions. Quality of the fois gras was again average and not worth the price at all. I got the wagyu meat for main, which was pretty good I must say. Desert was also above average. Again, great atmosphere, beautiful setting but for this price one would expect a lot more than what Jeff's Cellar can offer. A lot needs to be improved to make this place a worldwide name, deserving the price that it charges to its customers. One can start by improving the staff's knowledge and really work on the quality of the food especially at the appetiser level. Or they can reduce the price, which can make it worthwhile. If not, the 20rm salted chicken in Ipoh City or the good offering at Pomelo is a better option from a price to quality proposition. There's great potential especially due to the unique setting of this restaurant, but a lot more effort needs is necessary before making this a truly memorable experience.

"ShaggiesueSingapore, null, Singapore",One word ......AWESOME !,"After reading good reviews I made attempts for reservations, I was over the moon when Raymond and Cheryl helped me with the reservation for dinner. We were on an adventure trip, the first cave we went was GUA Tempurung in the morning (Grand Tour) my teenagers were already filled with Oohs....the rest of the 3 temple caves bored them a little. But once they stepped foot into the Retreat....Bang! They asked to stay at the villas (next visit)! For the start, the management arranged for a butler to show us around the villas, pods, spas, crystal cave etc. The introduction was good and detailed, except that there were mozzies that tagged along for some free blood (please bring insect repellents!)Cave no.5 of the day ...inside Jeff Cellar ...the ambiance was so Awesome! My 15 year old called it ATAS! You can see the amazement in those eyes when they compared to the 4 other caves they conquered earlier. We were led into The Cellar to view the Chairman's private collection....mind blowing!The food that we pre-ordered from the menu was fantastic, we had to order a second round of soup (Ala cart Special Thanks to the chef for accommodating my 3 hungry teens) to satisfy ourselves with the freshly baked bread, both whole meal and plain bread were warm and soft. The mains were well done and the portion was just right! The desserts were just unforgettable. Everything was perfect just that the promotional Champagne was not available and we settled for a bottle of sparkling wine.The staff Ms. Apple was bright and cherry, in fact all the staffs were polite and accommodating. We were going round and round taking photographs at every corner, too beautiful to miss anything.I have recommended Jeff's cellar to a colleague who will be visiting Ipoh in December. Hope she will enjoy as much as I did.My family and I will definitely plan for at least a one night stay in 2 of the villas. To those who have not visited, this is really a unique, romantic and peaceful get away from the stress.

I have given Jeff's Cellar three stars only because I think its a must-go restaurant because of the unusual location. But the food was a real disappointment. Otherwise I would have given one star maximum. For the meal, you have to buy a set menu for RM270++ and all courses were bland or salty, and one dish of mushroom ravioli I couldn't eat at all. The chocolate fondant dessert was excellent but that's all. The service was very good and after our meal, the waiter showed us the private cellar of Jeff's wines which was great to see.

Food was tasty (briyani, masala, naan, mocktail, etc) The parking is great, location is easy to find, the ambience is fantastic. It was a busy Saturday (as expected) and we were the first table to order and soon, other customers were arriving. Well, weekend patrons do expect a crowd. However, we also expect ""more waiters"" when you have a big place with ""more tables"" to serve. The only drawbacks were 1) the drinks were served in a horrible sequence (pardon my word). 5 drinks were served when we have finished our meal, after several reminders to a few different waiters whom we managed to get hold of. 2) the additional order had taken too long. Eg. Additional portions of rice/ curry/ naan. We received 2 dishes after we thought they have forgotten them, and I had told them earlier to cross it out from our receipt. Then, I told them to amend it, that we would pay for the dishes. You could tell they were understaffed and were really busy. No one checked on our order (if we have gotten everything/ drinks, etc), no one came to take order for our desserts or mocktails, and no one came to refill our glasses of water. We had to wave franctically to the waiters to get the menu for additional order, to check for our drinks repeatedly, to get our bill, etc. Upon placing our order at first, I had checked if we should order our mocktails all at once, but we want them to be served after our meal. The waiter assured me he would come and take our order after our meal. Of course, no one came until we approached them, to order our mocktails. We may visit again, for its food and ambience. However, we would definitely arrive again very early- that is at 6pm, when they open for dinner. Secondly, we would order everything all at once, to avoid having to add on dishes or drinks to our order.

Selection of yogurt was good. There were different types and cooking styles of lentils. The butter chicken and the lamb/mutton is not what I would normally have back at the restaurants in KL, the selection of breads were excellent, and not to mention the quality of the beryani rice. Speaking of quality, I spoke to the extremely humble Mr Darshan, the principal of the restaurant. He explained to me their selection process regards to the spices and other ingredients - most of the stuff comes from India. No wonder the taste exudes pure quality. It reminds me of the food that we ate at The Oberoi in Gurgaon, India and also in Amritsar. The quality and taste is very much similar if not better.Another thing very noticeable, which if I had noticed I'd be very annoyed, was that the food we ordered was not oily at all, unlike the Indian food at many other restaurants.My boys tried their selection of mocktails and were they pleased!

Starters were unremarkable (potato patties and onion bajji) and IF I ate there again we would skip the course and go straight to mains.

For what amounted to over MYR 50 per head with no drinks (bar water) and no desserts, you would have thought we could have expected better service than at our local hawkers but we were to be bitterly disappointed. I don't know if it was because we dared to ask if a mocktail could be prepared without ice (it couldn't) or if we were of the wrong race (all tables with Indian clientele had two waiters attending to them) or if there was no apparent manager/owner around but the service was laughable...we were served and ate our starters...so far so good. Then sat for 20 mins with dirty plates in front of us...these were only awkwardly taken when our next course arrived. When we had finished with that, and bearing in mind there were at least 7 waiters and only 4 tables occupied by then, we waited another 20 mins then had to ask to have the table cleared and for the dessert menus (waiters were far more interested in clearing and resetting the unoccupied tables for imaginary customers). Only half the table was cleared then we were just left with the menus. No-one cleared anything, asked how the meal was or if we wanted dessert. Eventually I called a waitress over and asked her to clear the table. This was obviously beneath her and she called someone else to do it. Another wait...then when I asked for the bill having given up on ordering dessert we were queried: ""Don't you want to order a dessert?"" We paid and as we left 3 members of staff near the door said goodnight but no-one bothered to hold the door (bearing in mind my 81 year old mother was with us). Food 4 stars (don't bother with starters) service 1 star. Would I come back if in town again? Yes for the atmosphere and food, and just to see when a manager is in place (assuming they are sometimes) just what a difference that would make. If I was the owner of the restaurant and had observed what had taken place I would be livid...four lots of drink and four desserts not ordered due to the staff...not sure how many businesses in this day and age can afford to treat their customers with such disdain.Show less",3,Reviewed 14 July 2018 ,Tandoor Grill

As we approached the shop, we noticed many locals and visitors drove up tothe front of the shop and ordered boxes after boxes of chicken (the driver just waved their fingers to the shop keeper and they will pack the boxes and deliver them to the hungry people waiting in the car). Interesting sight!We bought one box (planning to have it for supper when we reach Penang). After tasting the chicken, we regret not buying more. Haa!!! The whole chicken is free-range chicken ('kampung' chicken), wrapped in parchment paper is well seasoned with rock salt and chinese herbs (dang gui). As it is kampung chicken, the yellow skins contains very little fats and the meat is very tender and flavorful. It is best eaten with bare hands (no cutlery needed). In fact, we ate it straight from the fridge and it taste fabulous with wine (there was no microwave oven in our first Penang accommodation).When I was young, I used to eat Salted Baked Chicken with my family.

The staff was carrying trays of dim sum (+ other dishes) in&out from the kitchen all the time. Btw, I don't agree with some comments saying that they are rude. There's the language barrier with some of them but that's all. I found they were all lovely people.I also could see that the owners are very passionate about their job. They only use fresh meat and make sure that the fried dishes aren't too oily. Also, portions are not big so you get to try a big variety.

Some of them even put our patience to test when they continued sipping their tea after finishing their meal and settling their bills without any consideration of us waiting to nurse our stomachs after a wait for 45 mins! Finally when we managed to take over the table, the elderly waitresses just came around in trays with stacks of tim sum served in little aluminium containers instead of the usual wooden ones! A peek into the containers expose the tiny portion within! Everything came in small portions...far from money's worth!

To my dissapointment, it's just an average dimsum, it might be the best in town but it's no where near dimsums in kl/hk. Hence, that hype of coming all the way to ipoh just to try the dimsum is not worth it. Something I find good about the restaurant is the siew mai and har gau are very small in size, which is a good thing compared to the typical size of hk dimsum that is too big to finish in one bite. Furthermore, the fried items such as wu kok and ham sui kok are crispy as well. On the flip side, the fried dishes are abit too oily and the ma lai gou I had was cold in the centre which means they didn't steam it for long enough and also proves that their dim sum are not made fresh on the spot.

Of course if you go to KL you will probably to be able to find better but if you are in Ipoh and looking for reasonable Dim Sum this is a good place to go. Portions are reasonably small (but isn't Dim Sum meant to be bite-sized?) and the food is tasty. The restaurant has a good range of dishes and is a very reasonable price for what you are getting. Food can be a little oily so make sure you bring some Chinese tea with you.Now for the flip-side. If you are a fussy diner or you want any type of privacy you probably won't enjoy this place. You often have to wait for seating and it is not uncommon for smaller groups to share tables. Tables can sometimes be a little oily even after the servers have hurriedly given them a wipe down. They give you a bowl of boiling water with your plates/cups/cutlery and you essentially have to clean them yourself. Servers are often very rushed and you sometimes have to call a few times to get their attention. Note that any refills of hot water for tea are now self service.

Food was too expensive for its quality.Servings were really small, but it's good if you have the habit of ordering multiple items & sharing. You see servers everywhere, carrying food items. So the waiting time for your food is virtually nonexistent.I hated their egg tarts. In Hong Kong, I could eat 10-12 similarly sized egg tarts at one go, but I had to force the 2 that I ordered here. The egg custard was acceptable, but the skin was undercooked inside & so very, very thick.I counted more strips of ginger than bits of century egg in the porridge. I ordered Century Egg Porridge!Chee Cheong Fun was filled partially with air. The accompanying sauce was incredibly salty.

Being new to the area, we checked online for suggestions on where to eat and this place popped up. It was not difficult to find. Parking was a challenge because it is situation on the main road and you will have to park a few blocks away.The ambience is rather unique and quaint. This restaurant is set in two run-down pre-war shoplots and there seems to be a deliberate attempt to keep the deco as run down and as original as possible. This rustic deco seems a little overkill with mismatched deco and not very appealing.Now comes the food. They serve Western fare - burgers, pastas, pizzas. We had the Jammy burger which is about quarter pound of beef pattie. Sadly the burgers did not come with fries, which you have to order as an additional side. At RM19 for a burger, price is rather steep if it does not come with fries.We also ordered the Whacky Prawns pasta in pesto sauce. The portion is reasonable, at RM19.No complimentary iced water was given, so you have to order their drinks.

The peanut butter and the banana blend really well ... the vanilla ice cream really melt in your mouth and ..(Yes, I'm drooling over the thought of this crepe). The crepe goes well with a cup of coffee, or cappuccino or the latte'.The chicken egg tart is also one of the best dishes - or I'd say it is my favourite. It is actually a chicken quiche' - the size of the tart is as big as your small plate and the owner put a generous amount of ingredients as the filling (egg,milk,capsicums, some other vege that I can't identify).

The deco. is very interesting too.We tried their latte (double shot, strong), cheese cake (small but delicious), pizza bread (pre-made, heated up upon order) and macaroon. Overall very satisfied with the quality of the food, but the price is kinda crazy, especially for Ipoh's standard. Cheese cake and latte - ~RM10 each. Macaroon was RM5 (I think). The dessert bill came up to be higher than our 4 course Chinese dinner at a popular restaurant. Would I go back again, probably yes, mainly due to the convenience of the location and I dunno where else to get a good cup of latte in Ipoh.Show less",3,Reviewed 31 July 2013 ,Burps & Giggles

The first burps serves main dishes such as burgers (have a go at the portobello burger - yummy!), cakes (the banana chocolate cheese cake was the one that did it for us!) and certain pastries (like quiche). The second is a drinking hole called Giggles (aptly named) with couches and an open space. The third is called Buku Tiga Lima (translated to triple five book in English. It is a small little book we Malaysians used to use to keep track of everything - from your twelve times tables, to a long standing bar chit, to orders and deliveries and what not). Buku Tiga Lima serves more tea time snack (from the menu I read - not too sure if they have mains) - bagels, tea, pastries, etc. They are all nestled within restored pre war shop houses. They are right opposite Mubarak and Sons (the bookshop). The ambiance is one of nostalgia, serenity and happiness. I love this place to bits.

Certainly the decor is unusual, being a blend of a raw and rustic aesthetic. Walk to the back and also visit the art gallery and bookshop while you're there.Food wise we tried an assortment of their burgers: Bam Bam, Jammy and Greeko. The burgers are medium size and made with fresh ingredients, but in the realm of gourmet burgers (at which level these are priced) I've had better. For example, I reckon MyBurgerlabs in Sea Park PJ is better and those I've had in Australia and NZ are significantly better. For one the burgers at Burps & Giggles are too wet (probably too much mayo and other sauces) and the combination of ingredients is ok, but doesn't quite hit the 5-star mark. The patties are also not quite as substantial, well grilled and fragrant as others I've had elsewhere.The chunky cut chips are thick and crispy.

I pointed out that we had planned to dine together and eventually the second meal arrived . Both meals were poor , one was potentially dangerous as the chicken was not fully cooked through. When we complained the 'chef' claimed it might look like blood but was actually the marinade ?

The price was almost 3 times higher than the ones served in shopping malls and the famous Sister Char Guey Diao in Penang. Expectation was not high but at this price, it better be good! And,we were not disappointed! In fact, we loved it! The portion was big enough to be shared by 2 persons if one is looking for a light meal. Prawns are essential in this dish and it had 4 big ones! It tasted really street kind of authentic. Only the cockles were missing as chef felt that it may not be suitable for our international guests. Overall, we totally enjoyed this light meal!Due to this we had high hope on the breakfast buffet the next day. However, the choices were not that much, with mixtures of local and continental choices. We didn't mind the small selection of choices but we did care about the quality, and sadly to say, we were disappointed especially with the local dishes. They were tasteless.However we would like to give a big shout out to the team serving at the restaurant!

"shamalkumar87Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Not up to par for a 5 star establishment ,"For a 5 star establishment that is priced accordingly, Pomelo was disappointing at best. We had one dinner, thinking it was more moderately priced vs Jeff‚Äôs cellar, the other restaurant in the establishment. Unfortunately, with the exception of the samba nasi goreng, everything else was pretty much tasteless. I believe Jeff cellar also receives their food from the same kitchen. Hence, I would strongly advise guests to venture out of the resort to Ipoh to enjoy excellent local cuisine at far more reasonably priced rates. You can then return to the resort and enjoy a drink at Jeff‚Äôs Cellar. This would be a much more enjoyable experience and value for money.Show less",2,Reviewed 24 December 2017 ,The Pomelo - The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat

"aurfeiKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A gastronomic experience‚Ä¶ and beyond,"Chanced upon the reviews of this restaurant on TripAdvisor and even with some slight apprehension, decided to give it a try and boy was I positively blown away. The restaurant is part of the Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat, and apparently is the only restaurant in the resort. The resort itself is really tucked away, and almost gives an impression of being deserted with really dim lighting when we arrived in the evening. I understand that the restaurant is not really open to public, so it is definitely advisable to make a reservation beforehand. There were not even resort staffs around when we arrived so we had to find our way in a maze-like forest to locate the restaurant, though it seems that usually the staffs would lead the guests to where they intend to go. The restaurant itself is of open air concept, nestled within dense growth of trees and sits beside a hot spring, giving the guests the feeling of being really close to nature where you can hear the night insects as you work through your meal, though you would also have to deal with the tropical humidity.As we are being seated in the restaurant, what appears to be the executive chef even came to our table to have a chat with us and that only added to the positive experience. I went for the degustation menu and every dish was delicately put together, excellently plated and wonderfully gratifying my every palate, evident from the fact that every plate put before me was cleaned through and through. True to its name, local infusions are given to the dishes and the use of pomelo gives some of the dishes a refreshing touch. The Tuna Maguro and the Sarawak Pepper Glazed Lamb Rack were particularly satisfying and really savoury. The coffee though had some kind of a strange smell but the staffs were kind enough to replace it for us. The price point is steep, but nothing you would not find in some of the higher end restaurants in KL, and bear in mind that this is fine dining after all.The experience is not complete without a visit to Jeff‚Äôs Cellar for after dinner drinks, and I cannot emphasize enough that this is the highlight of our evening and you SHOULD NOT miss it! We were led through a rustic, rundown walkway to a pair of heavy wooden door which is the entrance to the cellar and behold‚Ä¶ the cellar is actually a limestone cave! Exquisitely decorated, sensuously lighted, awe-inducing fa√ßade, mysterious darkness overhanging above and with water features within the cave‚Ä¶ add to those an interior climate being kept to a chilly cosiness, it really felt like a complete departure from the outside world. Put simply, this is a truly and utterly brilliant piece of work! One could only imagine the painstaking efforts and creative nous put into every detail in conjuring a natural limestone cave into a wine cellar as tastefully and wonderfully put together as this. You could literally laze around in here for hours, sampling the extensive range of rare vintage on offer, and the acoustic effect of the cave somehow adds to the immersive pleasure of the background music that has the effect of willing your worries away‚Ä¶ making you feel as comfortable as being at home, but only better! You could even hold a private dinner here if you wish by making advance reservations with the resort.This is one of those experiences that you must try, and it is definitely well worth it. Thanks to TripAdvisor and the reviewers, I certainly had a wonderful and memorable anniversary dinner to cherish :)Show less",5,Reviewed 23 December 2014 ,The Pomelo - The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat

The restaurant boasts healthy cuisines, and is an extremely affordable fine dining experience. Despite having a relatively small menu, the scrumptious meals are adequate and do not disappoint. Though not big on seafood, I found my black cod thoroughly refreshing and enjoyable. A visit to The Pomelo would be incomplete without a visit to Jeff's Cellar - an exclusive bar located within a limestone cave - situated 50m from the restaurant. Like its aforementioned counterpart, the selection of alcohol on the menu is extremely affordable for its gastronomic experience. The ambiance and scenery inside the cave is simply breathtaking and unforgettable.

"Jagjeet SPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",A Fusion of Creation and Nutrition for Wellness & Healing !,"I am a firm believer of a healthy nourishing fruit breakfast to break the dawn and what better way than a breakfast specially prepared for you by the French chef with great care and fusion. I generally like small helpings as I do not like to over-stuff myself and feel uncomfortable after that heavy meal. So, when new Chef Bruno Delamare cooked my breakfast with hardly much oil, it gave me a good start for the Jungle Walk I was about to go on the later part of the morning. We both started with a sugar-free fruit juice - mine was kiwi while my spouse had his favourite mango. I went for The American while my spouse settled for The Continental but soon changed to The American when he eyed the way my omelette was prepared by the chef. First, I fell in love with the healthy Bakery basket which came with a good assortment of a variety of wholemeal buns , hot from the oven, complete with butter and fruit perserves and honey. I just loved the bread and especially the croissants which I gathered were all baked in the morning!Then what impressed me most was the way the omelette was prepared - just the right mix of some small cheese cubes, tomato, sauteed mushroom, and some other ingredients spiced with chilly - my preference - done with the right amount of oil and rightly done. This was served with small chicken sausage - not oily at all - delicous hash brown and wiltd spinach. I then indulged in freshly brewed organic coffee instead of the herbal tea. If you prefer both you could ask for it without extra charge. But my advice is don't miss out on the organic eggs!I had the privilege of chatting with the chef as most diners had already left by the time my meal was over. He spoke of the 5 Pillars of the Healing Process which I found fascinating . These were Detoxification, Weight Loss, Fitness, Rejuvenation and Longevity. I don't know if you will be able to make a choice, but I felt I needed all of them but Weight Loss. The meals are based on these 5 Pillars. The chef 's knowledge was impeccable as he said he had gathered these details from his reading, studying and experimenting . He seemed to believe a lot in the fruit, vegetables, herbs and spices which he felt was the key of healthy, nutritious healing food. When you are growing in years you suddenly become engrossed in these new ideas and want the best for your body - both external and internal for isn't it good health that we all want as we grow in years? Remember the adage Health is wealth!He spoke of how a lot of food we eat is tasty but oily , fried and often has excessive salt and sugar. He uses special pink salt , pure Himalaya organic pink salt - get him to show you so that you have an idea what he is talking about. He also uses sea salt from France - pure natural organic salt and spices and herbs but no butter at all except for certain desserts in small proportions. His unique mango compote and tartar with coconut and lime emulsion ordred by my spouse and the chocolate (uses the highest quality of coco in its pure form from France ) warm fondant were out of the world. I just loved the desserts that were uniquely created. The unique presentation of every dish was a surprise and it instantly created your appetite. WE both shared his Signature Dish of seafood The Bouillabaisse. I specially liked the blue eyes Cod from Australia in banana leaf as it had a spice flavour and taste because of the green chilly ... this will be a favourite of Asians. I could go on and on of his soups and his meals which are a fusion of a lot of home-made stock and Japanese spices and herbs and the method of cooking that fuses French and Japanese cuisine ; a French base of stock and ample use of star anise, fennel, tomatotes and lime and ginger . I recommend you try the blue eyes cod if you have an Asian preference for the chilly; the Signature Dish if you like stock and seafood but you cannot finish it alone so you have to have a partner to share it with you . Make sure you have space for desserts as I wouldn't miss the Melon, Chocolate or Mango dessert .Show less",5,Reviewed 18 December 2011 ,The Pomelo - The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat

You are greeted when entering the restaurant and when you leave. My family went there twice during our 1 week stay in Ipoh. The Brittany Shake I had there was one of the best milkshakes I've ever had, and the coffee was very nice as well. The food was just as good. If we ordered anything with meat, the meat was juicy and delicious. The serving sizes were 'just right', in the sense that when you finish them you don't feel too full or stuffed. The prices are a little more on the semi-expensive side though. The staff were friendly and efficient as well. However, what really stood out to me was the fact that the caf√© uses and sells metal straws. As a Malaysian, I know there is not much awareness in eco-friendliness, so seeing any sort of advancement towards improving a caf√©/restaurants eco-friendliness is an impressive feature to me. However, there is no toilet in the caf√©, which is a downside. The caf√© is also located near concubine lane, a popular tourist attraction in Ipoh.

Eventually, we ordered the signature char siu dish which turned out to be the better of the so so .... salted egg lotus root, long bean and bitter gourd we were excited to try; or the party chicken explained as 'har cheong' (shrimp paste) marinated chicken ... which turned out to be fried belacan chicken; or the bitter gourd black bean tofu, which was something you could find at any common Chinese food stalls.

The squid was really tiny and lots of heads (so don‚Äôt order if you are not a fan)!

It was definitely one of the best Wat Tan Hor I have eaten, the noodles were smooth and accompanied with a fragrant egg based gravy. Both combination made a great pair. Feels like drinking a hearty scrumptious soup rather than eating noodles but I am not complaining.The Hokkien Mee on the other hand was average and maybe due to demographics, I prefer the ones served in Kuala Lumpur.The Yuet Kong Hor tasted like a combination of both the Wat Tan Hor and Hokkien Mee. Wouldn't recommend ordering this if you have already ordered Wat Tan Hor and Hokkien Mee.Should also order their braised egg/tofu and meatballs. Not forgetting the ever so famous, Ipoh Ngah Choy.Be wary though by not ordering from the wrong restaurant as located just next to it is a restaurant called ""Sin Tuck Kee"".It isn't difficult to find a parking if you are willing to walk far but if you are lucky enough to find a parking nearby, you will be pestered by ""unofficial parking attendees"" directing you to a vacant parking space and they will require payment.Business on the weekend is bustling so unless you are prepared to wait, avoid this place =)Show less",3,Reviewed 4 October 2016 ,Ipoh Tuck Kee

"Ellsy BPenang Island, Malaysia","Nice or not, depends much who you are","If you are a foreigner or first time visitor to Ipoh, YES! this is a great location to experience Ipoh. Yau Tet Shin St. is a famous street: Night vendors, famous Ipoh chicken and taugeh restaurants, shops selling pomelos, Ipoh snacks, souvenirs, etc lined this street to the next. The dark back lane has its share of interesting story. Ask any local to tell you. At Tuck Kee, there is a variety of fried noodles to try. Best go in a group so you can order as many types of noodles; Wat Tan Hor, Hokkien Fried Mee, Moonlight Noodle (a must try ), yellow noodles, etc . Though it is called a restaurant, the experience is much like a street hawker style - oily floors, crowded, table seating are extended out to the street, dirty plates and utensils are swept into a big 'trash' bin, servers who work hard at trying to keep up the orders and demands of customers, hence the lack of smile and friendliness. But then again, this is Ipoh.For locals, especially those coming from Selangor/KL, if you did not get a chance to try Tuck Kee, you did not miss anything really. There are many good ones in KL as well. For novelty sake, go for the Moonlight Noodle and Wat Tan Hor. The rest on the menu, nothing much to shout about.For die hards Ipoh 'Malis', as some have shared, it is not about how good the food taste but instead, how the food experience triggers off that part of your brain that brings out ol' memories of childhood days.

"FWFSIpoh, Malaysia",Appalling Service and Terrible Attitude,"In the past, the service has been at least decent but it has gone from average to terrible! During my last visit which was just last week, we were first greeted with a disclaimer that we should choose to go if we could not wait due to the crowd. As far as my eye could see, there were only hardly seven tables and only about four tables that had not been served. So with patience, we waited for about 45 minutes. Then there was a commotion and loud argument exchanged between the kitchen chefs and the waitress. The commotion disrupted our peace and the serenity of the ambiance. A table behind us which had just been seated for a few minutes was being served with drinks and food. The table before us and our crowd were taken aback as to why the patron after us was being served. I stood up and queried the waiter and he just rudely dismissed me and told me that I had the option either to leave or wait. His attitude and treatment towards us as patron was demeaning! I was asking a valid question and would have been pacified if he could just apologize for the mix up etc or at least have the courtesy to inform me how much waiting time is expected. I would take my business elsewhere since I was not welcomed. Such attitude is unacceptable.Not a place to recommend if you expect that the service quality to commensurate with the price of the food and ambiance of the place.Show less",1,Reviewed 28 May 2013 ,Purple Cane Tea House

So, during rainy season, this is a bit of a hassle. My family outing on this particular night was raining quite heavily. However once you enter the restaurant which is formerly a bungalow, you will be transported through time. The furniture and decor are rustic old charm. Food is good. We were a group of 8, so was given a corner. Food selection is not bad. Western and Asian fusion. Top of our favourite will be the curry laksa and the soft shell crab rice.

"Tim DIpoh, Malaysia",Absolute disgrace - NOT Thai food,"My wife and I had a great meal at this restaurant about 2 years ago and we were craving good Thai food which we had been served previously. As the downtown Koh Samui restaurant was closed, we came back to Little Elephant. The place is under new ownership with a different menu but they still had some Thai choices. We ordered Tom Yam soup, green papaya & mango salad and Oxtail soup. The food came amazingly fast - like weirdly fast. The salad was simply grated papaya and mango with 4 cashew nuts. NOT one drop of dressing - so no fish sauce, no lemon juice, no dried prawns, no ground peanuts, etc. The tom yam soup was dark brown in colour and when they put it on the table and said here is your Tom Yam soup I honestly thought they had made a mistake between the oxtail and tom yam as it looked exactly like the oxtail soup. The taste was horrendous. If you read all my other reviews they are generally very positive. There is not one thing I can be positive about the Tom Yam soup - it was simply awful. After tasting the salad and the soup I only ate the 4 cashew nuts and left the rest. My wife's oxtail soup was OK, but the main reason to go to Little Elephant was for the Thai food and it was disgraceful. We will never ever visit again.Show less",1,Reviewed 11 January 2018 ,Little Elephant

"HelleborinIpoh, Malaysia","Mix of good and average food items, limited menu choice","Atmosphere/Service:-Good ambience. Tastefully decorated to create with a fusion of Asian styles. Went there for lunch on a Sunday and there were a decent number of patrons there. -Spacious, comfortable seating, and no problems with customer service. Food: -Limited menu choice. The restaurant has a variety of cuisines (Western, Malaysia, Thai) and in doing so provides limited options in each. -Tried the (Chef's Recommended!) Nasi Kerabu Ayam Percik: disappointing. I highly advise AGAINST it. The chicken, sauce and rice were all flavourless, and depended too heavily on just chilli to bring out the taste. The crackers on top were the best part of the dish. -The Prawn Pad Thai pasta dish was quite enjoyable, so perhaps their strength lies in Thai cuisine?-Dessert options were pretty much just ice cream - the matcha and red bean ice cream was not bad. Not sure what they were trying to do with the cornflakes at the bottom. Overall, as Asian fusion restaurants go, it's average.

"mooman801Singapore, Singapore","Authentic, Tasty and Satisfying","Came to this establishment late into dinner service. Was offered seats at the Ramadan Buffet and after browsing the menu we decided that it made more sense to eat at the buffet. I'll give a run down of the more significant dishes that hopefully reflect positively on the ala carte versions. Fish Curry - this was amazing. It is so very hard to get fish curry just right. It is a fine balance between the tartness of the assam, the heat of the chili and the symphony of the spice blend. Their interpretation was spot on. Great depth of flavour and robust body. Both the vegetables and the fish meat were cooked to perfection. Curry was good enough to eat on its own with naan. 8.75/10.Tandoori Chicken - was a bit dry, but perhaps because it sat on a heated serving platter for a while and we had come in late. But it was well seasoned with perfect seasoning. Nice smokey heat of the chili with strong hints of the actual charcoal from the tandor it was cooked in. 8/10Chicken briyani - if all Indian restaurants were judged solely on the quality of their chicken briyani, Pakeeza's chicken briyani was truly outstanding. A perfect melody of spices, basmati rice and chicken. Chicken was tender and moist yet retained a strong chicken taste. Rice wasn't overcooked or undercooked and had a wonderful texture. 8.25/10The milk tea (teh tarik) was outstanding. It is a strong tea with condensed milk. Added it to a cup of ice and it was the perfect companion to the spicy food. 8/10.Naan and poori - can't give a good assessment as they had been precooked and had sat in the serving dish for a while. But I'd say worth the try. Desserts at the bufft seemed like they were from a 3rd party vendor. Nothing really outstanding. Restaurant was clean. Can't speak of the service as we opted for the buffet. But staff were polite. Price was good, RM48.9 for unlimited servings of good Northern Indian food.

It was then that I decided to come here last Sunday for lunch. And boy was I impressed by the newly refurbished upper floor that used to be a banquet room. Mixture of vintage sofa and Art Deco dining chairs and tables. Nice. But that's not the only thing I'm shouting out about. The food. Oh. My. God. It was by far THE BEST North Indian/ Moghul style cuisine. My Colombian friend was with me and he agreed too! We had the beef paneer, mix vege, plain biryani, the naan breads and the most tantalising, melt-in-your-mouth tandoori chicken I've ever tried. This is 10/10 for us! It was perfect. The complimentary curry was also good. We had the mango lassi with our lunch and it was so refreshing and not overly sweet nor sour. If we thought we could not eat anymore, we were wrong. We shared a kulfi, it was just perfect balance of creamy and not too sweet. The masala tea followed afterwards. Plenty of roasted almond slivers in it and for 10rm I thought it was really a good deal! Overall the food was good, the service stellar and the ambiance perfect. It's refreshing to find out also that this place that has been here for years and still, it withstood the test of time especially when the food quality is still of importance to the owners.

However, we were surprised to see it was a fine dining restaurant with good ambience and well laid tables. We reached on time to catch a light meal before they close for a break at 3pm. One of our friends were vegetarian that Saturday so we looked for vege meals to be shared among the 3 of us. There were many items on the menu and we settled for cheese naan and potato stuffed kulcha. And we ordered the highly-acclaimed roasted almond masala chai. The food arrived shortly and I noticed they served very aromatic tantalising fish curry with the breads. However, we refused it as we wanted all vege meals. The waiter then explained that it was vege-fish curry (it tasted and smelled absolutely like real fish curry) so we dived in. Happy to say, we stuffed our faces with all the yumminess. We were so full when the much-awaited chai arrived in moderate sized mugs! One sip and we were all in heaven! I have never tasted a masala chai as heavenly as this to the point I had to slow down and savour every drop of it. Lots of crunchy almond flakes in it. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to any chai lovers out there.

After letting them know about the mistake, they were quick to change the dish. But I wasn't pleased that all they did was just add the butter ""sauce"" over the previous tandoori chicken. So, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that their butter chicken is cooked in a tandoor. The taste of the food was definitely nothing to shout about. I would say that they're doing a grave injustice if, in fact that was really the taste of authentic Pakistani food. Apart from that, the portions were reasonable and the overall ambience is cozy.

Had a couple other dishes that were just as wonderful. When the dishes arrived, they looked small and we were worried it might not be enough. But don't let the look deceive you.

"albatross-549Melaka, Malaysia",More hyped than genuine,"For this city of Ipoh if one enquires about a good restaurant for Indian food, one can expect the answer, ""Oh you may try Pakeeza"" So it was with much expectation that we visited this place,located very close to the city centre.The place is not big enough but is generally very well patronised and it gets full to its capacity in a short time soon after dinner time starts. The ambience is very ordinary unlike most of the better Indian restaurants one sees in India. The furnishing also is quite basic though it is comfortable. Looks like it is the trend in most of the restaurants in this part of Malaysia. The food is what one goes for to a restaurant and in this department, the place is a great disappointment. The menu has a good variety of Indian dishes but the preparation fall much below the expected standards, and even they fail the test of authenticity. For a foody this is a big let down and put off. Therefore, I have decided not to go there again.We have tried their chicken,mutton and fish preparations with tandoori roti. Last month we took our guests for dinner out The mutton preparation we were served was so bad that it looked not to be their own preparation. Probably it was brought from a near by Nasi Kandar (local Malay restaurant). When it was pointed out, the general behaviour of the staff was quite disgusting. Instead of diplomatically accepting the shortfall, we were told that the customer should expect this level of standard only. We ordered tandoori roti and paratha, but were served with tandoori roti AND normal paratha. So I feel in the absence of a viable alternative, it is enjoying a good run with not so knowledgeable foodies of Indian preparations chosing to use it.

It is standard English food identical to that you would have found in the 60s with desserts like Bombe Alaska and Crepe Suzette that a certain generation will recall.

It was done to a 70% well done/ 30% raw and not to mention the beef is not fresh, and the meat is literally like chewing on rubber. The BBQ sauce to compliment the beef was so watery, and not flavourful. I would never order the any beef from this restaurant again, considering the $70 pricing could par with KL but, they do it properly cooked and fresh.I also requested for a warm water, the waitress looked at me and she was so confused like it's the first time for her to serve warm water. Like hello?? Not everyone wants sweet drinks, and the purpose of warm water is the wash down the sugary intake.Food definitely could do better in this restaurant, considering the premium pricing they are charging for the food and drinks.EnvironmentThis place could definitely use an Interior Designer to properly design and regulate the place to a premium restaurant standards. I could not even properly see my food due to the poor lighting here!

Now, here's what I like & do not like about this cafe :Likes : - Overall, the food is delicious (this is the comments from everyone who ate here; about 20 of us) - I especially like the gourmet beef burger (this is my order) because the beef patty is juicy and cook to perfection. Most of the desserts we ordered are awesome especially the chocolate lava cake & tiramisu! - we sat upstairs and the ambiance is so cozy and inviting; the grass is green & so fresh for the eyes and at that very moment, you feel that you are not in MsiaDislike : - there was 2 waiters who served us but one of them is younger man, in his 20s and has a stylish hairdo is kinda rude. When he served us our orders, he stood there & shouted the name of the dish that he's carrying and expected us to respond to him. Now, we have 20 of us there & for such a nice establishment, I would expect the service crew to be more courteous when serving customers. He should have went to any one of us and get us to help him; no need to shout like you are serving us from the coffee shop in town! I didn't make a fuss because we were all hungry.

To add insult to injury, they forgot about our takeaway order (we ordered dishes for dine in and takeaway at the same time, and asked them to prepare them all at once so we wouldn't have to wait - we were on a time schedule to catch a flight).Overall the experience was just so-so. If this was the only place in Ipoh to eat, they it would rank better in my book; however, Ipoh is chock full of places to eat. Many of these other establishments may not have the ambience that STG has, but they deliver better food at a cheaper price with better service.For me, it's all about the total experience.

The ceaser salad (RM19) was a good size serve and even came with some chicken. The smoked duck appetizer was also good. I also heard the burger (RM20) was satisfying. Some other items were a bit of a miss, like the house salad and greek salad. The tiramisu was above average, the black forest cake was nice.The menu also contained some local food items, but at about RM20 each for these I think these are overpriced (especially here in Ipoh).

My only real concern is that this restaurant has not decided whether it is Asian or Western. It is actually a bit of both.

"mooman801Singapore, Singapore",Neither Nonya Nor Thai but some Interesting Interpretations,"I've grown up eating and cooking good nonya (straits chinese and my family heritage is of the Melaka interpretation of nonya). They say that baba (another name for the straits chinese) mother in laws were draconian when it came to food as they valued what their precious sons would eat when they were married off. The hours my grandmother spent perfecting a simple sambal belacan is a testament to this idea. Let the review continue...Came here for Sunday brunch after lazing at the hotel till past breakfast service. Came hungry but unfortunately also came with pretty high expectations. Ordered the following: sambal prawn with petai (stink bean), ladies fingers (okra), sambal kankong, basil chicken and white steamed rice. Sambal prawn with petai - prawns were not fresh, sambal was not particularly outstanding and petai were on the verge of going off in that they weren't firm. Normally this dish is the first one polished off, but alas it was left half eaten. 5.5/10Ladies fingers - outstanding dish for all of us. Vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection, tender yet supple with a bit of crunch left and the gooey insides and seeds intact. Sambal this dish was served with was excellent. Great balance of heat, texture and taste. 8.5/10Sambal Kangkong - Also good and was served with a slightly different sambal than the ladies fingers. But in comparison with other sambal kangkong served at hundreds of Malaysian and Singapore establishments, Yum Yum's interpretation was above average. 7/10Basil Chicken - confused. Initial taste is intriguing. Basil and chicken are good friends but with the coconut milk, it didn't quite hit the mark. Chicken was somewhat overdone and tough, perhaps from sitting in a giant pot for hours. Beans and onions that came with the dish didn't quite add the texture and flavour that were needed. Worth ordering if you want to try something different. But wasn't mind blowing. 6.5/10Overall, I don't think that nonya and thai quite go together. Having much experience with nonya and having dabbled in thai cuisine, I'd say keep them separate and pure. There were some nonya dishes that I felt were missing: chap chye (mixed vegetables with dried tofu and mung bean vermicelli), a whole host of pork dishes were left out likely due to halal certification, ayam buah keluak, bakwan kepeting (crab meat, prawn meat and chicken and/or pork meat ball soup with bamboo shoots). I would have thought that with Ipoh's proximity to Penang, another centre of gravity of Peranakan/Nonya culture, the nonya food here would impress. Sadly it didn't. So I would be honest and say that if I had known they didn't serve pork I'd not have bothered. No offence to my muslim friends but nonya food without pork is like sambal without chili.Opted to skip dessert as we weren't impressed with what was served. Toilet was clean.

High on my list of favourites is the mango kerabu (but beware of the chili padi hiding amongst the vegetables) and the assam prawns. The chef has somehow managed to permeate the prawns with the appetising assam flavour, a feat which many restaurants have failed to achieve.

The plate of beansprouts which was normally seasoned with some pepper, light soya sauce and sesame oil was lacking in flavor too. But the Soup Hor Fun and the homemade chili garlic sauce still had good flavors.

Once you're done ordering, payment dude will come and calculate your bill and give you a printed receipt. Cash only. Had the roast chicken, steamed chicken, bean sprout salad, and, meatball and fishball soup. Roast chicken - seemed to be the chicken from the day before that wasn't sold and refried. Somewhat dry. Not lacking in flavour but lacking in texture and percieved freshness. But still edible. 6.8/10Steamed chicken - well prepared. Chicken in Ipoh seem to be the ""kampong"" type or you can say ""free range"". They're not as plump and delectable, come across as scrawny and less well endowed, but taste great. This one seemed boiled and had good texture and taste. But have had better. Cucumbers with the dark sauce the chicken sits in with the red chili sauce have nice mouthfeel and taste. 7.5/10Was is essential in chicken rice is the actual rice that is served with the meat and the rice here is lacking in flavour and particularly in the texture department. Grains had no body and the taste was sorely lacking. Less than mediocre. A barely passing grade as rice wasn't overcooked and was still edible. 5.0/10Bean sprout salad - everyone in Ipoh raves about the quality and distinctiveness of their beansprouts but I was not particularly moved. Somewhat over seasoned and salty too. It was alright. 6.5/10Meatball and fishball soup - try to avoid the fishball. Especially if you're visiting from the West. The texture might not agree with you. The texture of fishballs in S.E. Asia can be considered an acquired taste. Most of my white friends don't appreciate the texture of fishballs. What is a saving grace is that the meatballs have bits of salted and preserved sole fish mixed into them and this lends a nice bacon like salty bit experience to eating the meatball. 6.8/10Ambiance is nothing to crow about it is street side dining and has no air conditioning. So at lunch time on a hot day it can be rather uncomfortable or as another traveller said to me, ""authentic"". :)Price for 2 half chickens (1 roast, 1 steamed), 4 rice, bean sprout salad, meatball and fishball soup, and, 5 drinks came up to RM97 (EUR 20).

But, turns out they serve us another pork ball soup (RM10) which we didn't actually wanted to order at the first place. ~Noodles - if you had the chicken soup noodles at ""Nam Heong Kopitiam"", trust me, u will taste this noodles like nothing that special at all. ~Ice Sour Plum Drink - If you planning to get diabetes, you can order this.

13makmalaysia,Steamed chicken done the best way - naturally,"You won't get special or premier service because you would probably have to wait for a table, unless you don't mind sharing with others (provided they allow you to do so)...but if you go earlier as soon as they open, you will get your own table to yourself.Drinks are pre-prepared and the few choices will be carried to you and you pick and choose which one(s) you like and just take it off the tray when served and you will be charged accordingly. But the real masterpiece comes when you are served with the chicken. The flavouring soy sauce and fragrant oils are so aromatic .. you will feel sudden pangs of hunger brought about by the flavours and aroma. This is one of the best chicken anyone can get in Ipoh, and their bean sprouts are succulent and inviting.If you think this is a ploy to whet your appetite, please do not believe this write - try it out yourself and you will not regret it.But do be patient before you are served...once you are served you will start missing it once the last piece is devoured.

The chicken was boneless and tender. There was the strong fragrance of sesame oil. However, we realised that this was not the firm and flavourful kampung chicken.

Not Sin Hup Kee restaurant. I've been visiting this restaurant for no-hassle dinners a number of times a year over the last 8-10 years and they come up trumps EVERY SINGLE time. As many of the other reviewers have commented here, this place is noisy and the reason is simple: to my mind, it is the only restaurant in town that offers the freshest ingredients and cooked just right; no-hassle, courteous service; minimal waiting time (upon order, as they have 3-4 chefs at any time); at the most affordable and best prices in town; to the point that it's affordable to the Everyman. A plate of sweet-potato shoots is M$6.00 at Sin Hup Kee when it costs $10-16 at most of the other restaurants (yet these other restaurants will not be able to match the tender young shoots you get at SHK). Try their assam (tamarind sauce) or steamed fish to get a taste of their freshness. On the whole, you can expect a meal at this restaurant to cost 15-20% less than at most other restaurants and that's just half the story - the freshness of their dishes and the consistency of their quality, EVERY SINGLE TIME is straight-up unmatched by any other restaurant in Ipoh.

Soon Chin TKL,"Sensational salmon, better steak elsewhere","We first visited Citrus in May and this is our 3rd visit in a month. Its exterior looks like a typical shop but once you walk in, you literally feel that you've entered someone's well-loved kitchen. Every visit we were here, whether lunch or dinner, tables were reserved for large groups, a testament that this place is popular with office and family crowds. Service was excellent, lead by a husband and wife team and attentive staff. Erica always made us feel special and if the kitchen ain't to busy, Simon, the head chef comes out to say hello.Food wise, we love the prawn pomelo salad - light and refreshing. The pumpkin soup, broccoli soup and oxtail soup are all yummy. Mushroom soup was second best only to Ben's (Ben's makes theirs in a lighter version which we prefer). The soups are served with a piece of warm thick bread with salted Lupark butter. We'd prefer it served with the garlic bread for extra crunch (although the garlic bread could do with a little more garlic like Maria's Steakhouse).For mains, we come here mainly for the salmon (rm37) and cod (rm68) - cooked perfectly that they literally melt in your mouth.The spaghetti is good too. Many diners rave about the steak. We agree that it is great. Only that we prefer the ones at Maria's - their sauce is to-die-for. Dessert here is creatively thought-out. But we don't missed it. Wish they had tiramisu though. Overall, this 12-year old restaurant is a cosy place for lunch and dinner. Parking has always been easy for us. We put the fish ahead of the steaks here. And the staff goes the extra mile for you. Don't expect huge portions on your plate and you'll go home pretty satisfied. Show less",4,Reviewed 4 June 2017 ,Citrus Wine & Dine

The service was quaint and we were pleasantly surprised that the food came relatively fast! A must to order are their lamb racks or steaks; they're all cooked to perfection and the portion size is just right. A normal 4 course meal will land you with a bill just above RM100 ( at the time of writing and without wine ) but I can assure you that it's worth it!Parking may be an issue and you may have to park really far from the restaurant, so be prepared!

The atmosphere is friendly and busy - Citrus has always been full when I've been there - and perhaps the only faint reservation would be about the slightly harsh acoustic - the murmur of conversation becomes a bit more than a murmur at busy times! The food is the main attraction, though. Some of the appetisers we tried between us included seared fois gras (sumptuous), grilled scallops and salmon roe salad (delicious), sashimi salmon 'Citrus-style' (melted in the mouth) and a long-time favourite, wild mushroom soup. The braised lamb shank is another favourite and the duo of fish (with seared salmon trout and scallops) is beautifully done! Perhaps the piece de resistance, though - well worth saving room for - is the Affogato (see picture) which is a 'soup of espresso and Grand Marnier drizzled at the table over a double-scoop of vanilla ice cream. A perfect finale to a gastonomic delight! We brought a nice bottle of Bordeaux wine with us, as the corkage charge is reasonable.

The soup consistency and flavour are well. Sampling a few restaurants which served mushroom soup in Ipoh, I can confidently called this one of the best mushroom soup in the town!Our main courses are grilled chicken with potatoes mashed and grilled salmon with grilled vegetables and potatoes mashed. The chicken is very well marinated, seasoned and perfectly grilled, leaving the meat juicy and tendered. The potatoes mashed as the side is silky smooth and creamy, really yum!The salmon is really cook to perfection! The salmon skin is perfectly renderd, brown, crisp, thin, salty, crackling with no more greasy, gelatinous fat underneath. Really thumbs up to the chef. The fish is very well seasoned on both side and has thin layer of ever-so-slightly flaky meat underneath that, followed by a wide expanse of tender, juicy, not-the-least-bit-chalky flesh, and a central core with a creamy, buttery texture bordering on sashimi-esque.

The location is only 7 minutes away from The Lost Hotel according to Waze and GPS but still took an effort to find as we had to drive through a couple of quiet neighborhoods to reach the restaurant.There were ample parking outside the restaurant and when the waiters saw us trying to run in from the car in the drizzle, they were quick to come out to meet us with umbrellas. A good sign for things to come!For a Thursday evening, the restaurant was pretty but we managed to get a table quickly.I would describe the menu as Western-Asian fusion. Pretty extensive menu with enough to please everyone in the family.For starters we had a mushroom soup, a grilled prawn and pomelo salad and bruschetta. All excellent. Soup was hearty and of generous portion, including a side of warm herb bread. Prawns were grilled to perfection, retaining its freshness and flavor. It went very well with the pomelo and green salad in a citrusy dressing. The bruschetta is served with the garlic bread and Tomato salsa separately. I was surprised that my 2 daughters who normally would not take tomatoes, were happily taking the salsa with their garlic bread!Our expectations were high after sampling their appetizers. So when the mains of Black Angus Steak, Seared salmon trout and Hokkaido scallops, and a couple of pasta dishes came out, we were again impressed at the quality of the food and the presentation of the dishes.Meat was tender, fish was cooked just right, and the sauce that came with both dishes married all the ingredients into a delectable dining experience!By Dessert, we were game to try anything the Captain recommended. We had the Trio of desserts (ginger creme br√ªl√©e, crepe in caramel iced bananas, strawberry pannacota), chocolate molten cake and apple crumble served with cinnamon ice-cream. Again, everything hit the right spot. The sweetness of the chocolate was tempered by a hint of salt. The apple crumble was sublime with the cinnamon ice-cream. The trio of dessert had elements of Asian ingredients to give it an unexpected flavor. The manager and captain soon caught on that we are 'foodies' and served us a complimentary bread and butter pudding. They were also happy to share with us recipes for the tomato salsa and accommodating to our son's request for marshmallow and sprinkles on his gelato.We had a great experience in Citrus and would recommend this restaurant to all our friends.Show less",5,Reviewed 11 September 2014 ,Citrus Wine & Dine

There are 2-3 options for an appetizer, about 20 options for the main course (half spaghetti and half meat/fish dishes), and finally about 7-8 options for dessert. We were there as a family of four, so we had quite a variety, and we enjoyed almost everything we tried. Slow cooked lamb shoulder was very tender and flavorful. Seafood spaghetti was very good too.

Thank goodness for Google and TripAdvisor as it was was a gem hidden in Ipoh.We started with a selection of homemade bread with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar followed by the chefs appetizer. The mixed appetizer consisted of a piece of seared tuna, a scallop in a garlic cheese sauce, prosciutto, tomatoes (I think marinated in balsamic vinegar) and a piece of egg tortilla. The tomatoes was surprisingly nice; it was served cold and cleaned up my palate for the next course . There was a wait for the main course however with the relaxed ambience and crisp dry pinot grigio's we never noticed. I had the miso salmon and my partner the pork - both beautifully cooked. The sides for both dishes was served with 2 pieces of dressed sesame chinese vegetable and a creamy mash. I think the mash was a bit over powering for the salmon. Last but not least we finished with dessert. It was a challenge to choose the desserts from the menu but we ended up with good old Italian tiramisu and recommended by the waitress chiocciole (dark chocolate with brandy).

Or if they have a lot of diners at the same time, they will either advise you to take an earlier or later reservation, or not even take in any more reservation.

stormlccIpoh,Master the Basics Before Doing Your Own Thing,"I love Italian food, I also love Japanese food. However I have my reservations for ""fusion"" food such what this restaurant has to offer. You see, a lot of fusion restaurants tend to incorporate more than one kind of cooking into their dishes without first mastering the basics of one particular cooking style. This tends to make the taste of their food out of balance and balance is what separate the good from the bad, or in this case, the good from the great.Lets get one thing straight off the bat, some of the dishes (at least the ones that I have tasted so far) in this place is above average compared to other places in Ipoh, and IT SERVES PORK which to me says ""the chef has some balls! and integrity"" because it is very very difficult to survive (in the F&B industry) in Ipoh if you are not giving 2 hoots to our Malay friends. Many many entrepreneurs who opened restaurants that serves pork in this place closed shop because they were unable to serve the 30% Malay population (at least) thus loosing potentially 1/3 of business revenue. And I love pork. For me, if you are not serving pork in a so called ""Japanese"" or ""Italian"" restaurant you DON'T DESERVE to be called that because pork is the soul of the food of these 2 great nations.Now comes the specific (personal) analysis of the dishes that my group ordered. Firstly the appetizers, the Caesar salad with bruschettas and mushroom soup. The dressing of the salad is spot on, very nice and not overly dressed. To me it is the perfect salad. But it comes with 2 bruschettas and one of them is the ota-ota flavoured. Seriously...ota-ota? If you want to do something different just for the sake of doing something different, DON'T. It RUINED the whole salad dish. What did I say about balance of flavours (this sentence will repeat very often in this review)? First you serve me a fresh, well dressed and very refreshing salad and then you expect to tingle my senses by that ota-ota? Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike ota-ota, I like it on it's own, but not with a perfect Caesar salad. On the other hand, the mushroom soup just tasted like any regular mushroom soup that's was in a package from a Tesco.Then I had my ""Classic Carbonara"" which is quite confusing because there is NOTHING CLASSIC about this dish. When it arrived I found some bonito flakes on top albeit a very tiny amount shaved very thinly, you would hardly notice them if you do not cook any Japanese dishes. I do, so they are very obvious to me. Ok then, it's NOT Classic in any way, they should name it ""Fusion Carbonara"" instead. This is just nitpicking in the name and I apologize to waste your time. The question is: WHY? Is it to enhance the flavour of the dish? You can't, not with this tiny amount. Is it to enhance the presentation? You also can't, not with this tiny amount shaved this thin you can hardly notice them. So what's the point? Please be reminded that this is a pasta dish that consist of at least 30% cheese in it, so any subtle ingredients in small amount will just be wasted. The fundamental basics of how to make a good carbonara is the balanced mix of good cheese, good eggs and parsley to accentuate the richness of these 3 core ingredients. The cheese is there for the richness. The eggs are there to combine all the elements, to soften the taste of the cheese a bit and also to make the sauce smoother and runnier. The parsley (which a lot of people ignore and is more important than you think) is there to provide balance of flavours between the 3 core ingredients, to lessen the blow of the cheese - egg mixture and to provide colouring to the whole dish. I am disappointing to say that the parsley was not there in this dish. This caused it to look bland, and too rich because they put too much cheese in the mixture and the balance is totally out.There's the 'Pasta with Bacon and Cherry Tomatoes' that my wife ordered. Most of the time this combination of bacon and cherry tomatoes is perfect. You have flavourful smoky bacon and you have slightly stir fried sweet sweet cherry tomatoes, how can you top that? By adding in long beans? NO! Usually long beans are great if they are the main ingredient but in this case, they are just SOME ingredient they chef put in there to be different. If this pasta is called 'Pasta with Long Beans (with bacon & tomatoes)' with long beans as the core of the dish then it will be great. It's also the way they cooked the long beans. They have been very slightly stir fried to make them look fresh and light green. Good if it's on it's own, bad if mixed with other subtle ingredients. This is a grave error in this particular dish because the their smell covers the entire dish. We had a pasta that only taste like under-cooked long beans with a slight hint of bacon and tomatoes. It's like the rookie's error of under cooking bell peppers for a pasta dish, the whole thing will just taste like raw vege.I almost forgot to mention the pasta itself. If you know how to make fresh pasta yourself it wouldn't be anything special but if you don't (not interested, lazy etc.) then it is something worthwhile to try it out in this place.We also ordered the Sakura Pork which tasted quite amazing. It very juicy and tender with good flavour and reminds me of freshly roasted Chinese pork with a pineapple sauce. Speaking of pineapple sauce, this sauce is the highlight of the day. The balance is spot on, the flavour is incredible and it compliments the pork perfectly.Then comes the dessert. I am not THAT into sweet stuff, but some of the options here are quite good. The Chocolate Mousse is GREAT, it's got a hint of bitterness to it which I love and it actually tasted like Belgium Chocolate and the Creme Brulee was not bad (which is high praises from me). But the Semifreddo is not my cup of tea. The Tiramisu is quite acceptable except for the taste of alcohol was too strong, balance of taste is not up to par here but I applaud the chef for using alcohol, at least it's made the correct way and it's really home made. There are just too many shops in this country selling disgusting feces and they dare to name them Tiramisu without a hint of alcohol in them and then charge a fortune to rip people off. This place is NOT one of them.I also want to mention the environment. There's no denying it, it's quite nice and cozy because the place is so small. The decorations are kept at a minimal but everything is clean and very inviting. The only issue we had is the weather of Malaysia and El Nino. On that evening we are experiencing super high heat, and the 3 tiny 1-2hp air-con units in the dining room were unable to keep up with. They should have installed 2 units of 5hp air-con but due to (presumably) their inexperience in running their own business they opt to save cost in buying 3 units of small air-con. I pity them because in the long run, their electricity bills will stack up like mad, since small air-cons uses so much more juice when they are running at full capacity compared to big ones running at low in the same environment.The conclusion is this restaurant can do better and has huge potential if the chef can adjust his style a bit and improve on his basics. I just hope TNB bills will not make them close shop.Show less",3,Reviewed 2 March 2016 ,Maiale Japanese Style Italian Restaurant

"irene chan ai l... cIpoh, Malaysia",Delicious food and reasonable prices in a cosy ambience,"Owned and run by a young couple, Maiale brings pasta with a difference to Ipoh. If you are expecting the ordinary bolognese, you'll be sorely disappointed. Chef Sato has many unique concoctions up his sleeve and brings even the ordinary bolognese or aglio olio to a higher tastier level. I strongly recommend the freshly made pasta by the chef himself. Return and return and return...to try out all his different pasta concoctions with Japanese touches.Although I am not a fan of salad, I must say Chef Sato dresses his salad really well. If you opt for salad in the dinner set, you would find a little lovely surprise in the form of otak-otak bruschetta. Otak-otak, by the way, is fish paste with fragrant spicy marinade.All my friends and family who have tried Maiale's creamy mushroom soup gave it a big thumbs up. I like it very much too, but I am equally impressed by their tomato gratine soup. And their soups are served with scrumptious bread and bun, all lovingly made by the young couple.Another specialty of Maiale lies in their to-die-for desserts. They have a really heavenly tiramisu, bonet (dark chocolate pudding), pavlova, panna cotta (my husband and my mum's favourite) and creme brulee. Now the latter is served in....well, I shall not spoil the surprise, you'll just have to go and order it to find out for yourself. Creme brulee is sometimes given a twist; crafted in houjicha or matcha flavours (both being Japanese tea).To think that Maiale's main dishes start and end with pasta would be doing the restaurant a grave injustice. We tried their wagyu beef (can't remember the name of the dish) and were really impressed.

Pricing is what I consider mid-range - Not fine dining expensive but not cheap either but, in my opinion, well worth the price. If there is one down side to this place, it is that it is located in a very busy, vibrant area and there is much competition for parking spaces so that can be a bit challenging. Other than that, when in Ipoh, treat yourself to a visit to Morel - You won't regret it.Show less",5,Reviewed 15 June 2019 ,Morel

We ordered 6 dishes of which 5 were of very high quality and we were extremely satisfied with the meal.My favourite dish has to be the claypot pork slices in dark sauce with ginger and scallions, and the deep-fried fresh water river prawns. We tried the steamed marinated chicken served with ginger sauce which was a house specialty and were not disappointed. Both the vegetable dishes were delightful - we had kailan stir-fried with yam and the Romaine lettuce sauteed with fermented bean curd. The restaurant captain recommended a bean curd dish which was okay but much to my liking - but I guess this is just a personal view as the other members in the group liked it.This is the perfect place to sample the best of Hakka food that Ipoh has to offer.

Elaine LLondon,Pleasantly relaxed dining atmosphere. Good dim sum.,"Arrived here bright and early at 7am. There was already a queue forming at Ming Court opposite, but there were still quite a few empty tables over here. I liked the high ceilings of this building, it felt very nice, a pleasant change from the usual shop-lot restaurants. Well, it turned out to be too early, many dim sums, especially the fried ones were not out yet. I suggest coming at around 7.30am. There were no dim sum trolleys here, you have to pick up dim sums from the counters yourself. Porridge and cooked stuff can be ordered from the table.Tried a few things here, but the ones that really stood out were: 1. Steamed cheong fun with prawns. Unbelievably soft and smooth, and great flavour too. Must try!2. Loh Mai Gai. The glutinous rice was cooked to perfection and very tasty.3. Egg tarts. Great pastry and custard, but the yellow colouring was a bit too much.4. Claypot porridge. Well seasoned, great thick texture. Yummy...Most of their traditional dim sums were OK. Their newer ones like meat floss roll and bamboo charcoal yam pau were not impressive. I prefer the food here to Ming Court as they are more consistent and hygienic.I must talk about their tea! Not cheap, about RM3.40 per person, but they do the best tea (in a tea pot). Very concentrated, not like the watered-down crap in most places. We had Pu Er & Chrysantheumum. Even after a few brews, the tea still tasted amazing!Service was decent. Waiters were quite attentive and quick to pick up empty plates. Not sure if it is the same when it gets really busy though. There were reasonably clean toilets here, with tissue paper provided. Can't say the same for most restaurants in Ipoh!Show less",4,Reviewed 15 September 2018 ,Foh San

After that we can go to the counter and choose what dimsum to pick, and give the order sheet to let the staff mark the price.

Lyna L,Simply Delicious,"The food was great. Even though we are all extremely fussy eaters, we were all happy with the food. Our compliments to the chef. We had the chicken butrito, lamb panini and lamb pie. They were tasty, juicy and tender. I believe some of the poor reviews were due to the fact that the expectation was very high as in a 5 star restaurant with 5 star service. Please..this is just a 3 star hotel. It is just a small restaurant. The fine dining refers to the exquisite food. The price is very, very reasonable. For 5 stars, you would have to pay at least 3-5 times the price. So, be fair. Oh, and of course, some of the food have to be precooked for those of you who complained it was not freshly cooked. You would have to wait at least 3 hours for lamb to be this tender. By the way, all 5 star hotel restaurants pre-cook most of the food especially certain western dishes that require slow cooking. Go ask hotel chefs.Show less",5,Reviewed 5 June 2017 ,The Limestone's Fine Dining

It was my 17 year-old son's birthday and we had a group of 17 people from 4 - 76 years old. Except for my husband and me, the rest were not used to European dishes. But everyone (the old and the young) enjoyed every dish that we ordered (seafood paella, flat noodles paella, soft shell crab, spaghetti, minestone and mushroom soup and all the mouth-watering desserts - crepe and waffles. What was really special was Xiao Ru's effort to make the whole birthday dinner experience cozy, warm and welcoming. My boy had the loveliest birthday ever and I am so glad we chose to come here to celebrate. I called to make the booking the day before, not really very sure what to expect but Xiao Ru called back later to discuss seating arrangements and etc... how thoughtful of her! She did explain that they have a small space and wanted to make sure that we would be comfortable in the best sitting arrangement.She and the team even carried out a slice of cake singing ""Happy Birthday"" to my boy! My brother in law (who is Ipoh-born, by-the-way) commented that he never knew such a restaurant with European food even existed in Ipoh! This is truly a gem. I would fully recommend this place to any visitors and even the locals if you are already tired of all the dim-sum and taugeh-chicken and the chinese dishes Ipoh is famous for. I suppose you could just walk in but if you want a slightly nicer experience, just call Xiao Ru and her team!Thank you again, Xiao Ru!

It was really fine and well presented. Since I went oversea, I still visit this restaurant every time I came back, however the standard has deteriorated over the years since its move to the current location. As a head chef myself, when I thought it can't be anymore worst by its standard the last time I visit last year, my experiences this time around has been horrendous at best. Over cooked steak, burnt paella, irresponsible waiters (pushing around when we expressed the unacceptable condition of the food, end up nobody ever approach is to rectify the issues), and really, while pricing are merely a factor for consideration when come to quality, the price are way overpriced for the standard of the foods.

To start it off, my appetiser which is the mushroom soup is tasteless, and very starchy, the warm soft shell crab salad suppose to be served warmed but it comes out chilled! And for second, I thought I've ordered a cold platter salad! My main course is trio crab ravioli which is way overly salt! Not to make it sound awful but I taste nothing but SALT! The dessert I ordered is some sort of chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake but when I cut the cake open, expecting chocolate oozing out from the centre of the cake, it turned out over baked, the texture is dry and there ain't any chocolate oozing out from the cake... And not, I'm not trying to be a harsh critic here and definitely hesitate to range any restaurant as 1 given any opportunity. The food here is literally not up to their name, nothing on my plate is ""Indulging"" and the only food which is good is my glass of Merlot for the evening, and that's explaining the 1 star I'm giving here, only if my Merlot is considered food!

Having read some of the reviews I felt that some balance has to be reinstated. A menu doesn't have to be full of flowery prose as we usually ask the server about the dishes and we can get a pretty good idea from a verbal description. Mostly, I like to know how a particular dish is cooked. Some of the best restaurants in the world keep to a simple description. The dishes we had, blood orange and mango salad with lamb bacon, mussels and lamb rack, were all delicious and executed to a high standard. The lamb in particular was one of the best I've had in recent memory. The desserts here are legendary, we had hibiscus souffle which was delicious. We also tried the mini cronuts, a cross between a croissant and a donut, a first time for me. The chef owner, Julie Song, is passionate about her cooking and it shows in the ingredients used as well as the taste. I doubt if there are better European restaurants in KL.

It's previous contender (that not many people know about because we locals tend to keep to ourselves) is gone (because the chef passed away recently).Another problem with this restaurant's review is that most people in Ipoh don't know anything about western food at all. I am not trying to offend anybody, just telling the truth. People tend to give high ratings because it is the ONLY thing they tried, they don't have other choices and they don't travel outside of their comfort zone most of the time.Although this restaurant has the ambiance and some fairly decent western food, it does not warrant such high marks because it's prices are ridiculous. The food quality and taste is not superb (just mediocre), and the quantity is...pathetic, yet they charge prices that are comparable to a 3 course fine dining for 1 dish!If the food is excellent, then yes I would gladly pay it, but it's just not worth it.

French dishes is not all about making the portion small and draw some abstracts using sauce on the big plate. Taste, presentation and service are important. The idea about kicking a guest out from resto every 2 to 2,5 hours is definitely not french. That is extreme greediness to profit as much as possible in shortest time possible.This place is definitely not for wooing dates, business talks or fine dining.

I usually pop in for dinners and I've been there ever since they set up the cosy little cafe next to the Canning garden market.Pros:The chef. She is good and creative with her fusion dishes and the meats are usually cooked to perfection, many Asians overcook their meat to the consistency of a rubber sole, but not here. The rack of lamb was perfect; so was the beef. Wine selection is huge and the restaurant offers good menus with wine pairing; you can't blame the prices because the government taxes the alchohol highly. Parking is easy, right in front of the restaurant. Cakes and desert were fine as well, consistency and ingredients were fresh but slightly a tad too sweet for my personal tastes.Cons:Service service service. You get those sulky, unfriendly waitresses. I had the feeling the drinks and cakes took hours to reach the table. There is no service with a smile here. The chef is in the kitchen most of the time; so maybe she hasn't noticed. The service seemed to be much better when the restaurant was in Canning Garden when. Decor. Does not fit to the building.

"ctme2016Ipoh, Malaysia",An old established restaurant in Ipoh,"A general comment first....I believe that some of the earlier comments are meant for the other Tuck Kee ""restaurant"" located in Jalan Yau Tet Shin and is not airconditioned. This Tuck Kee is airconditioned and located in Pasir Pinji, a more ""classy"" restaurant and with a more extensive menu than the other Tuck Kee.Restaurant Tuck Kee in Pasir Pinji is a very well-established restaurant, and has proved popular throughout the years. The two floors are often occupied by diners especially at weekends. The food is usually consistently good. However, in recent times, we have found that we need to be careful when ordering....Case 1: At the end of last year, we made a booking for a table for 6 adults and 3 children, planning dishes which were special and more expensive than usual. The estimated cost was just around rm300. But after the dinner on the day after that, the bill was given as rm700, which was a shock. The chief waitress who had taken the order was nowhere to be found, and there was no choice but to pay up.Case 2: Just two of us went for lunch, and the waitress recommended a chicken dish which was deboned, small enough for two people to share, together with another vegetarian dish. The bill for the chicken alone came up to rm28, which came as a shock, as it was only a small dish. When queried, again the waitress who took the order was nowhere to be seen, and the others claimed that we had been given half a chicken. Again, no choice but to pay up.Lesson learned, always ask how much the dish would cost before making the order.Also, we were shocked to hear the staff saying that if anyone else came into the restaurant during this lunchtime, they would be asked to ""share tables""....which is a Malaysian thing to do in normal coffee shops and other smaller restaurants, but not acceptable in a classy restaurant.What won't they do next to make more money?Show less",4,Reviewed 19 September 2016 ,Tuck Kee Restaurant Sdn.

Though it is a small matter, but there is no integrity and ethics! They should inform customers how long is the expected waiting time so that we can make an informed decision whether to continue waiting or change to a different eatery. We ended up waiting 2 hours just for food to arrive (not including eating time) and almost everything was sold out. With so many years of business experience, the shop should've anticipated for this and catered to an increase diners as well as hire more part time workers to help with a faster turnaround time.

"ThCyKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",No more next time.,"We arrived at 8.30pm and the restaurant was fairly crowded. We got our table but nobody is taking orders so my husband took the initiative to order at the cashier counter. With that unfolds the beginning of our dining nightmare. First, we were served the soup, bean sprout dish and drinks and then nothing comes after that for a good 30 minutes. Then, every 10 minutes or so we were told that they start to ran out of each 'dai chow' dishes that we ordered. Some furious patrons around us even left after only being served drinks and left waiting for God knows how long. At this point, we feel that the orders have all been mixed up and the cooks simply whip up whatever they like. After an hour of fuming wait and out of the 4 main dishes we initially ordered, only the so-called classic dish 'yuet kwong hor' arrived as expected, which I wholeheartedly regretted because it doesn't concur with our taste buds. Perhaps I should have gone with the boring old chicken and hor fun for our dinner?If the foods served here were really Ipoh mali good as claimed, then this must probably be our unlucky night. The only compliment we have goes to the foreign worker who tirelessly make and serve drinks, does the table clean up and even multitask as a cashier! Salute!

Unfortunately we arrived on a Wednesday when they are closed all day, so could only visit once on the Thursday before we had to leave Ipoh! The staff are deaf and are so smiley and friendly. You are shown to a table and write your order down before handing to the front desk. We know some BSL from home however it was different to the (American?) sign language these people were using so we were taught a few new things! One of them came over and asked where we were from (on paper), then proceeded to teach us how to say 'England' and 'Malaysia' in sign. Don't worry if you don't know any sign as this is never an issue here! There are a couple of hearing staff who help translate between customers and staff if there's ever an issue. This is such a lovely initiative and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our short time at this place. Just sitting in this environment watching sign being used and the wonderful staff made our entire week. Myself and my boyfriend both work with children at home who have special needs and/or are deaf/mute, so we were so touched to know this place exists - to give these incredible people a chance to work. Asides from all of this, the food is brilliant, fresh and tasty. We ordered 'fish' and chips, and mushrooms in thai basil sauce with brown rice. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We also had coffee and soya milk, then treated ourselves to a slice of their vegan passionfruit cake which was insanely moist and delicious!!! Even for my meat-eating boyfriend, this place was a big hit. Meal prices are slightly higher than we are used to, however they are still in the cheaper range and portion sizes are not huge, but it's definitely quality over quantity here. If you are in the area, definitely don't give this place a miss - limited opening hours but so worth it, in our opinion. I just hope this restaurant continues to thrive and bring in customers as its such a wonderful place. Thank you for making our week :)Show less",5,Reviewed 29 March 2018 ,Vegan Delights

I was standing next to him and upon finishing taking order , walked away and didn't even acknowledge or say hi or greet a welcome.

Then another couple walked in. Obviously a friend of the restaurant as the cook ( or owner) came out of kitchen and wish and greet them enthusiastically. The couple is celebrating a birthday and the cook ensured that he was being served most and attentively. Incredible. For a restaurant that some have raved about, this is poor poor hospitality.

The key items promoted by the chef are steak and iberico pork. For steak you can also choose dry-aged or wet-aged beef. The place also serves some seafood items, but I've not tried them yet.You can also custom specify your items, just contact the chef, let him know your preferences and budget and he can prepare something to suit.All meals come as a set - the items you see listed on the menu are the main course. Once you've chosen the mains, complimentary soup and appetizer will be served (you have no control what these are, it's the chef's selection of the day). You will also get complimentary wine (by the glass and refillable) and dessert. Children will be given juice. So all in you get a set comprising the soup, appetizer, main course, dessert and wine/juice. Considering all this, the price is understandable (expect to spend RM150 per person and above).In general the food was prepared well and is tasty. However, there was one time that one item (iberico collar) came out a little tough and I informed the chef. After checking he said it was because the meat was cut on the wrong grain.

It was very thoughtful of them to give my mom a bouquet of flowers and even a cake for the occasion. But let's talk about the reason we chose this restaurant, the food. The chef recommended that we leave it to him to get an assortment of meats. So the first dish was the minestrone soup with freshly baked buns. The soup was really tasty and the bun was light and fluffy. Then we had a salad with shishamo (japanese pregnant fish). The shishamo was grilled perfectly but the salad could have a better dressing other than a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Then it was aglio olio spaghetti with truffles, tasted as it's supposed to be. Then there is the suckling pig. The skin was very crispy but we felt the herbs/marinade was a tad too strong. Then we had the iberico collar and secreto, the meat was pretty good but the pineapple and passion fruit sauce was a bit too sweet. Then the ribeye steak. Judging by the appearance, it was cooked perfectly medium rare. Unfortunately, it was extremely chewy. We were later told that they had accidentally cut the meat parallel to the grain instead of against it. BIG MISTAKE. To compensate, the owner gave us a plate of wagyu beef. It thought it was so-so. We ended the meal with grilled lamb which was pretty good. We paid RM1,008 for the meal for 6 people with 3 bottles of red wine. Plenty of room for improvement.

Great aroma and blend.The appetizer we had is scallops.. wooooohh its very fresh, juicy and tasty! The mains is SUPERB! Although my bf's mother said the salmon and King prawn is a bit dry but my bf (a chef) said its suppose to be like that since its grilled and no napkins on the table (might be a big problem for its juice to sprinkle around ellegant dresses). The lamb and beef was FANTASTIC! The lamb and the beef- even they never put much salt but it was AMAZING.. its the first time i tried a beef this juicy and tasty without a salt taste.. the flavour itself comes from the meat beneath.. no other taste.. its pretty good blend with mustard and herbs with salt which is plated with the beef around the plate.There will be dessert as well and we had the cream cake served on chilled glass.

You can use this as a base to start exploring the heritage sites and wall murals of Ipoh and come back here for a refreshing cuppa before venturing out to other places of interests.Show less",4,Reviewed 24 July 2016 ,Old Town Kopitiam

There is a well-known stall at the Paris Restaurant & Motel run by three brothers, and I understand that they used to be known as Yin Yau Kui Hakka Mee. The business was started by their grandfather more than 50 years ago. The brothers make their own egg noodles, which are cooked to the right degree of springiness. Add a topping of minced meat in soy sauce, famous Ipoh bean sprouts, a soupy bowl of ""liu‚Äú made up of yong tau foo, fish balls and meatballs, and you get a tasty breakfast.Pimp your bowl of noodles with the condiments provided at the table - a swirl of fish sauce, some chili-ginger-garlic sauce, and some 100% extra-potent garlic sauce if you prefer.

We had pineapple fried rice, brinjal fries, black pepper venison, steamed chicken with Chinese wine, Indonesian style fish with okra, stir-fry baby pak choy. The brinjal fries was a star on its own. Soft brinjal coated with thin batter, deep-fried, then drizzled with sweet marinade. It was delish. Another winner was the venison. The meat slices couldn't be more tender and the flavour was on point. The Indonesian style fish was excellent too. Steamed chicken and pak choy were average. For dessert, we had fruit and jelly platter, which was nice.The service was excellent. Waiters were very attentive. The table was cleared and cleaned for dessert. They offered extra chairs for ladies to put their bags and stuff too. Toilets were reasonably clean.

This place is just.....forgettable. And this is one of the worst traits of a restaurant, blandness, lack of character, lack of excitement. I can't even recall what we ordered and what specific dishes we don't like, the only thing I remembered was it was NOT worth the price they charged, the place was very tight because the tables were too close together with all those useless decorations that pretended to be antiques. Oh and the service sucks (it's that bad I was forced to use this word, sorry).I don't understand why so many people come here and claimed that they were ""consistent"". Consistent of what may I ask? Boringness? Ah, I finally remembered something about it's food after ranting for so long in this review, we had a deep fried fish with ""assam"" sauce. The sauce was OK (mediocre, nothing special, BORING.........) but that fish is a piece of frozen rock. They literally took it out of the freezer and then fry it IMMEDIATELY and it is the WORST piece of fish I have ever eaten.So now that I have remembered something about it's food, I retract my previous comment about it's blandness.

"Thulasi SKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Average food Terrible and biased service,"Visited this place yesterday with 11 family members and a baby in stroller and we called them 2 hours before to book a table. Once we went in we were given a table that can only fit 8 adults and before we all could be fully seated the waiter removed 2 chairs from our table to give another customer. This is extremely rude; we were already short of chairs and table and now the waiter makes things worse. The 11 of us plus baby in stroller had to squeeze in that table of 8, no one even tried to fix their mistake or apologies.On the food - overall the spread and taste is nice. Those who can't take heat and spice should go slow on the curry. Again we faced service issues with the food. White rice finished and the waiter was doing hard selling(almost forcing) us to take the ghee or briyani rice. We had to wait 20 mins for the rice to cook and be served.

The calamari was very fresh and batter was nice. But I prefer the plain batter. Overall, i was surprised the bill came out to RM110.

Theres ample space for car park too. For those not so hot and spicy tolerant i suggest you have the chicken soup for the steamboat.

"esquire838Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Worth a try,with so much hype and favourable reviews I decided to try it. Came the first issue: Google ‚Äúnasi vanggey‚Äù while in Ipoh and u have several to choose from. A traveller would not know if they are a chain of the same one or others use the variants of the name to ride on its popularity. Choose the one with most number of favourable reviews. Had a plate and lamb curry with a vegetable pate all for 9.80 which is reasonable. Taste is a divey thing; savour while one is hungry would return a different taste than when one had a hearty breakfast earlier.

Ayumijioh,Nasi Vanggey Special (tastier than it looks),"Coming to Ipoh there are like two types of curry rice you would have heard that you need to try of.- Nasi Vanggey and Nasi GanjaPersonally I can't tell the difference between the various curry rice I have tried- not every meal from a difference place can lead my tastebuds to identify a distinguish taste.I orderd Nasi Vanggey Special from Food Panda ( as i thought since I am in the mind for a rice meal why not go for the kill!) If I like it I can always put it in my to visit list again- if I don't, I have no regrets not ever trying it and passing comments.To my surprise... i actually enjoy my meal! It was finger licking good that i wanted to lick the plastic wrapper clean! I could distinguish how is Nasi Vanggey different from Nasi Kandar- it all lies in the curry! I am not saying one is better than the other as they are both a feast to enjoy!So i guess the key to enjoying your food and tasting it well is to eat when you are hungry! Everyone ought to give this a try when Ipoh! And of course with an hungry stomach! - if you don't like the heat of the day- you can order it from food panda app or grab food.Show less",4,Reviewed 15 April 2021 ,Restoran Nasi Vanggey

There is a wide variety to choose from. Whether its curry, korma, pan fried or deep fried, Su has it all. Mutton, chicken, fish, vegetables and many side dishes will be tastefully displayed on the spotless stainless steel shelf for one to choose.The dried curry mutton which is tender, juicy & cooked with a delightful blend of spices is heavenly. Spicy chicken is superb and well seasoned. The taste of curry which is neither too hot nor mild simply explodes in ones mouth. Fish is cooked to perfection while vegetables are fresh. Do not forget to take the crunchy popadums which even children will enjoy.As for my favorite, it is definitely the rasam. This is a south Indian soup with lentils as the main ingredient.

Since we decided to take the promo beer bucket, we ordered the mixed platter, sun dried tomato bruschetta and Chicken Ceaser salad.The beers came quickly so was really a good start with option to mix a stout.Then came salad, the only thing I like about it is the roasted chicken bits. The salad sauce has no body of olive oil, anchovies and garlic flavour only mayonnaise taste and sweetish. Parmesan cheese grating not found. What I dislike as well, pieces of chicken ham into the salad. This isn't a Ceaser salad to any standard in my opinion.The sun dried bruschetta is another anomaly. The french bread base is not toasted or baked crispy, came soft with chewy crust. The sun dried tomato is a joke as it looks as fresh as you can get. The mixed platter has no issue but nothing to shout about.The worst if the evening dinner is the loin of lamb. When it came, the cutlets was as tough as a mule. We complained and the server was very nice, offer to take it back and cook us a new one. Bravo, to this service!After quite a while, which we were not in a hurry and have a bucket if beers to finish, it came back. Now the dish has a black sauce compared to the original brown sauce. First thought I had was did they re-cooked it? As I dig into it I recognised the cutlets and my partly cut portion. When I try the meat, it was just as chewy as before with a maybe a wee bit softer but still hurt my teeth and gums. So, I complained again it is no good. I asked if I am being served mutton, all I get was a shrug. There was no apology or any attempt to attend to my feedback that a RM65 dish after tax and service charge was not satisfactory. In total, bill came to RM215 for a couple meal, even with off peak discount we paid RM186 was not value for your money with food and service standard well below par.So this restaurant has a myth that the food is good. I certainly will stay off this restaurant!Show less",1,Reviewed 25 June 2016 ,MYTH Eatery and  Bar

But it seems that they are most expert in western dish.. :) Salmon grill, sizzling chicken chop and pasta is good. I love their pavlova because it is not too sweet to my liking :)But don't order their local cuisine like noodles or kueytiow because it is tasteless - below my expectation. But you gan give it a try on their rice set which is ok to me.Show less",3,Reviewed 27 January 2015 ,Mat Periuk Cafe
nurultajudin,"Good Value, big portions, tasty","Food sampled: Nasi Goreng Atuk (pictured), Lemon Chicken & rice, Grilled Salmon, Penne Carbonara, Mixed Grill Platter, Grilled Chicken Chop, Pavlova, Daim CakeDrinks: Longan, Longan Cincau, Yellow Cincau LemonadeThe food overall tasted good, the nasi goreng Atuk which is one of the specials was very spicy and I would suggest it to only the most ardent fans of hot and spicy food. My fav of today would be the Lemon Chicken. Crispy chicken drenched in lemony creamy sauce yummm We ordered the Daim cake twice. I prefer the one here than the IKEA version. Yes, granted they're both different but since they bear the same name and appearance I am going to compare anyway haha. Mat Periuk does it well with that moist choc. I am not a pasta fan being most of my experience with pasta in Malaysia thus far have such a let down - but the penne here was well cooked, teamed with a creamy carbonara sauce - it surely hits the spot nicely. I'm curious to try the spaghetti bolognaise next.We changed seats a few times because we prefer good stable seating when we eat and while the decor is very rustic, bits and bobs saved, a rather eclectic mix and match of bar chairs, big oil drums and huge wooden wire reels - some seats aren't very comfy.Overall I would come back here again, maybe for that spaghetti. They open at 4.30pm - 12amShow less",3,Reviewed 25 December 2014 ,Mat Periuk Cafe
"stuffmattersLondon, United Kingdom","Cold beer, relaxed","Goo9 was a welcome stop on our Ipoh walking tour for a cold beer, air conditioning and a light lunch .

"Ian AIpoh, Malaysia",An Exceptional Cantonese Dinner in Ipoh,"There were ten of us last evening and this was my first time there and I really did not know what to expect. We chose the air-conditioned section where the temperature was just right. Service was prompt with plenty of advice and recommendations. The ladies ordered the food as usual and the basis was to have a large selection of medium to small sized portions so that we could try as many tastes as possible. We started with an outstandingly good fried rice and nine dishes later ended with fried noodles. In between there was a fish soup, fish hotpot, pork ribs, two different Taufoo, two plates of wonderfully crisp and fresh vegetables in different styles. Service was good and every dish arrived straight from the wok.To me, the highlight of the meal was the pork ribs. They were huge, succulent and melted in the mouth. They were nothing less than perfect. Add to that the excellent hotpot and the mouthwatering vegetables, this was a meal to remember.For drinks we stuck with Chinese tea although we also had BYO wine for which the restaurant provided very nice wine glasses. Then to cap it all they served two desserts free of charge.And how much did the outstanding meal cost? Less than RM40 per head!Quality, service and economy, Hong Feng has it all. I shall certainly be there again soon.Show less",5,Reviewed 18 September 2018 ,Hong Feng Restaurant
