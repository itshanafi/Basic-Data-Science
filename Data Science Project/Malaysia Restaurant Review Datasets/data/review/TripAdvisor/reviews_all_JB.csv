Food taste was good (except dal on the edge of salty)Quantity was average and staff was polite however I am only rating this at 3 star due to the fact that our food was served 45 minutes after the order being taken and that too after my wife personally went to the kitchen counter after we had already checked about our food couple of times with waiters.When she personally she to the counter and asked she was told that palak paneer is over and they can't serve it but no one came to us till that point to ask an alternate and only when we asked they mentioned this issue. Absolutely poor management.Our dinner was served in 10-15 minutes after this. staff was polite and surprisingly they served us Palak paneer(?)It could be that it was a public holiday and they were overwhelmed with the guests but that doesn't explain absence of communication and replies on repeated enquiry about our order after 30-40 minutes Wait.Would think twice before recommending or visiting again mainly due to poor management and service.Show less,3.0,Reviewed 5 February 2017 ,The Spice Kitchen

Had side of garlic naan. Palak paneer was spicy, tasty and was the perfect foil for the garlic naan. One of the best I've had. Lamb curry was tasty, the lamb was tender and melt in the mouth. Just the right amount of heat and spice. Tandoori chicken was well seasoned and it really permeated the meat which wasn't dry but was done just right. Pity it was served early so it was cold by the time we ate it. Garlic naan was a bit chewy perhaps the dough was overworked. But nevertheless it came hot and tasted good.

YvonneWoiMalaysia,A Melting Pot for Various Cuisines,"When I first saw the sign board of this restaurant that says Indian-Chinese (fusion), Thai and Indian and the impression that came to my mind was that the food must have not been authentic because most eataries and restaurants specialize in and focus on one cuisine. So I was rather apprehensive about it. Based on my first experience and several visits to the restaurant after that, the restaurant has proven my perception wrong. There ARE places that can serve several cuisines and still ace at it. Spice Kitchen is definitely one of them. What we really love about the space is the openness of the restaurant and there are few private dining space for those special occasions. It is clean and doesn't smell or feel greasy. The ambiance is very clean-line and modern with minimalist decos. The wait staff and manager are very attentive and friendly. We are very satisfied with the overall dining experience and the food is probably the star of the show. Most of the dishes be it Thai or Indian, are spot-on authentic and very delicious. The Indian cuisine is Northern style serving very good briyani rice and naan bread. The butter chicken is definitely the best in town and pad thai is very yummy! Spice Kitchen has become one of our family favourite dinner spots in the area and we are definitely coming back for more.Tips:1. The restaurant does in-house catering for private functions, if your guests prefer a variety of food, this is the place.2.

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Worth a visit,"Our first visit to Spice Kitchen was for lunch in July 2014. I was somewhat put off by the patronizing attitude of the Manager, and I felt we were herded to the table, not ushered. The food then was good, but overall, the service was poor. We visited again for dinner, and fortunately, had made reservations. It was a family get-together to celebrate a nephew's birthday. There were 17 of us, ranging in age from 2 to 80 years, and we had ordered in advance. We were pleased to note that a suitable table had been allocated and it was well laid out, with baby-chairs, etc. We ran into the same Manager and his behavior was pretty much the same. Not arrogant, but certainly not friendly. The food arrived promptly, it's taste was as before- a mishmash of flavours. Sour, sweet, salty and spicy at the same time. And yet, it all worked somehow and I was generally pleased with the fare. A lot of what we ordered was vegetarian (Mango Salad-good, Chilli Brinjal and Okra, Mushroom with Paneer, Aloo Gobi, etc), so no fear if you are planning on a no-meat meal. The non-vegetarian food was good too, consisting of Fish Tikka and Reshmi Chicken, Black Pepper Mutton and Devil Prawn. The dishes were accompanied by Naan and 2 varieties of rice. All in all, good. Not outstanding but good. The Masala Tea was very good, the Brew Coffee with fresh milk was awful. It contained sweetened milk and was not authentic at all. Diners looking for a more authentic North Indian experience should try The Village Briyani instead. There are many superior South Indian restaurants in Jb, certainly. Nevertheless, this is the kind of fusion food that still manages to please the palate. The restaurant was very crowded when we went, and there was a constant stream of new customers walking in. The staff had their hands full. The crowd was interesting, mostly high-end...thus making it a good place to people-watch. The prices are on the higher side but was not a deterrent to us. The ambience is more industrial than classy. It's not cozy either. But still, rather modern and refreshing. All in all, despite my reservations, a proper 4 star for the food, 3 stars for the service.

"acerockollaJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Consistently The Best Food In Johor,Since discovering the place with it's twist of Indian and Thai fusion I have been back many times and never been disappointed.

The biryanis, vegetables and chicken butter masala -- each dish couldn't be faulted. They give us a nice quantity of each dish. The kebab platter had 12 large kebabs, the biryani was really big... my son was delighted that he was serious abt the cheese when he ordered a cheese nan-- it had one nice layer and not a few sprinkles.

"tripasucksSingapore, Singapore",Easily one of the best restaurants in Malaysia,"The Spice Kitchen is one of the best additions to the greater Singapore/southern Malaysian dining scene. While the restaurant is conceptually about cuisines in South/Southeast Asian spices, what you really want to try is the ""Indian Chinese"" fusion cuisine - which is actually a lot better than it sounds. For the uninitiated this is cuisine that was brought to India by Chinese immigrants, who over time, adapted it to local tastes. Spice Kitchen may be the best example of this in the region - and better than many similar restaurants in Singapore (the manager, chef and staff are from Chinese Wok in Singapore).

"swordfish01Singapore, Singapore",food is amazing but price is unbelievable,"Some points to note:1. Went during weekday lunch and we were the only customer.2. There was buy 1 free 1 main dish promo at that time. So, if you take like 4 dishes, the cheapest 2 is free. The owner was pestering us to stop at 3 dish only. I was not too acumen on that but my wife insisted to order the 4th dish. She later told me the 4th dish would have been free hence why the owner pestered us saying 3 would be enough for us both.4. When the dishes arrived, we could safely say 3 would not have been enough as the portion was small. Ironically he insisted we ordered 2 plates of rice (about rm7 ++ each) as this did not have the promo. We were smart enough to order just 1 and the portion was sufficient for us both.5. We had chicken masala, fish sweet and sour, veg koorma and panneer butter masala. They were all absolutely delicious. With two small drinks, the damage was rm80++. Mind you, this was promo price. Imagine how much it would have been normal price. 6. The ambience was lousy. As though the restaurant is still under construction.7.

Mr Jega and Mr Roy ran that restaurant perfectly well and all the staff were great examples of these 3 mens' excellent leadership. The kitchen did a fantastic job with every course being prepared perfectly well. The seabass and wagyu were cooked just right. Every component of each dish was served beautifully and tasted spot on. Mr Jega took extra care of us, answered our questions, made us feel welcome and made sure all the details were right.

"sheila1026109Penafiel, Spain",I have very mixed feelings,"I have very mixed feelings about this place. The food was hit and miss. Pizza was ok and chicken quite below average with a very poor sauce. It was so poor that we could not be sure if it was intended for the chicken or the side salad. The warm bread was actually nicer than the chicken. No one asked us how the food was so I guess the chef is not interested. After serving us, no one asked if we want to order anything else. Also, another surprise. The ambience was ordinary and I had to sit facing some big equipment. No music, making the ambience even more dull. Their saving grace is their very polite staff and general hygiene.We reserved by phone directly to the restaurant at around 5pm but when we arrived, our reservation was not found. That was disturbing and probably the reason I got a machine facing seat.During phone reservation, the staff asked if it‚Äôs a special occasion and I said ‚Äòit‚Äôs my birthday‚Äô. I have seen in previous reviews and there is complimentary birthday cake given to other guests. I did not get any cake. The staff serving also asked if any special occasion and I said ‚Äòbirthday‚Äô and if there was any promotion for birthday. He said he will check and came back to say there was none. It sounds odd that some guests get recognized and some ignored. Not sure what is the discrimination policy here. Would it really hurt their pockets that much to give a tiny piece of cake or tart or macaroon? It‚Äôs just a small personal touch. Also odd that I am asked twice about special occasion yet it means nothing, causing me to believe more of being discriminated. Maybe because we are not big spenders as we don‚Äôt eat beef or drink alcohol. We then left to have dessert and coffee at Les Bouchons where we were treated far better than here, though it was just a small spend.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 5 September 2020 ,Tosca Trattoria Italiana at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

"simplytravelandeatSingapore, Singapore",We had a great dining experience!,"We had a great dining experience at tosca trattoria, doubletree by Hilton Johor Bahru. We were shopping for groceries and decided to drop by for dinner.As expected, the welcoming by the servers were awesome as we waited at the bar for them to prepare our tables. We opted for the outdoor seatings and that was a great decision. The atmosphere beside the pool was just awesome with the lightings at night.We felt pretty exclusive as there was not many patrons when we were there. We ordered a few dishes namely, the baffalo cheese salad, the mushroom soup, the seafood soup, carbonara, lasagne and braised beef cheek in balsamic vinegar. The ingredients in the seafood soup was fresh and they were very generous with the portion. Carbonara was cooked al dente and the sauce coated every strands of the pasta nicely. It was very flavourful and cheesy with the additional cheese on top. The server was very attentive as he overheard that the kids would be sharing the mushroom soup and served them on two separate plates on his own initiatives! Top-notched service standard displayed. The beef cheek was very very tender after braising it for a long time in balsamic vinegar and the meat was infused with the fragrance of it! A very well-done plate of delicacy! All in all, a great dining experience at a five star restaurant! Every aspect was well taken care of by the attentive server and that was complemented by a wonderfully prepared dinner!

However unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience. The only reason I am even giving one star up from ""terrible"", is because I would go for a quick glass of wine with friends while watching the sunset, as the view from the balcony is amazing, unfortunately all good things stop there. The service is truly appalling, none of the wait staff seem to know the menu or have any basic training. My friend had to order a beer 3 times before they brought him just a beer and not a shandy. The food takes an extremely long time to arrive and sometimes is doesn't even arrive and after 20 minutes of waiting you are told ""it's not available"". When the food does arrive, it's extremely low standard and not well executed at all. The cappuccino I ordered came in what I can only describe as a cereal bowl and it was basically just milk and no actual coffee.

With the great reviews, we were anticipating to celebrate our special day at Tosca. Nothing special, no complimentary dessert whatsoever.

My only complaint then was not enough ""tummy room"" to taste more variety of cheese that was available. So this time I only went for the Cheese Room/Antipasto buffet which was just nice for me. If you like cheese, this would be the place to be in - their variety of cheese is from around the world - Italy, France, Mexico, US, Australia. Their regular pasta & pizza is not too bad well, I had their specials squid-ink pasta which has the squid ink infused into the pasta rather than as a sauce ( and minimize the mess you make while eating).

982joshuag,Fantastic service with some food that can be improved.,"First off, the service here is really good! Friendly and approachable. They showed us to our seats and intro-ed the specials. So my wife and I ordered the linguine alle vongole & the 4 cheese pizza plus a long Island tea.A complimentary bread mix was served at the start. Breadsticks were ok. But the bread were tough and cold. It might be better if they were warmed before serving. The 4 cheese pizza was fantastic. The pizza as good as it tasted. The crust was light and to complement the strong taste of the cheese perfectly. Highly recommended. However, the pasta I would not recommend. The linguine was overcooked (not Al dente), and the clams were not fresh so I sent it back. The waiter/waitresses brought it back and changed my order to something else. Service is good. However, the response they gave from the chef was that that's how it's supposed to taste due to the wine(even when one of the waiters tasted it and said it didn't taste right). Like really? I'm not an expert in pasta but I've eaten a number of vongole and I've not recalled one tasting that bad. If that's how the chef responds, I would ask anyone to avoid the pastas.So I changed my order to a lamb shank. The lamb was really tender and tasted really good. The potatoes were ok but I think they use the kind of potatoes with more of a powdery texture. Would much rather they use the silky smooth texture potatoes for mash. The roasted garlic was a nice touch but a tad undercooked. If tasted for a little longer, it would have a less raw taste that would complement the lamb shank perfectly.The long Island tea was great.A pity some of the food didn't live up to the service standards here.

It was the perfect candlelit ambiance we needed to end the day as it was a busy and tiring day for both of us. I asked for non oily, low carb and light selections and the chef did great justice with a starter that was light, fruity yet surprising to start the evening on an anticipative mode. This was followed by a chicken consomme with ravioli for me and a seafood soup with smoked salmon for my husband. The soups were a tad disappointing as my husband found his seafood soup salty while mine was a bit bland. The Passion Fruit sorbet that came next was delicious and prepared us for the main course which was rack of lamb for me and a baked ocean trout for my husband. Both were clear winners. My chops looked too bloody for my liking at first but it turned out that the chef knew better. It was not gamey (which I dread) and the meat virtually melted in my mouth without the usual toughness usually associated with grilled lamb. Then my husband‚Äôs trout had skin which was crunchingly crispy and meat that tasted buttery. Delicious. Although there was considerable waiting time in between each dish being served (there was a sudden unexpected crowd that evening) but the staff were warm and apologetic and made admirable recovery measures. They extended a glass of wine to both of us to while away the time and at the end of the dinner, presented a small birthday cake to my husband complete with song.

It made the night for us, we really enjoyed the dining experience at Tosca.The food was also pretty good, the cod fish was delicious and the lamb chop was done just right for me. The mushroom soup was fragrant but not overpowering and the seafood soup was very appetizing with abundance of seafood in it. The margarita pizza was pretty well done too, though by then we were already too full to finish it. (I have to admit, we over ordered our food)The ambiance in the restaurant was fantastic for a romantic fine dining experience.Price wise, it is on the slightly more expensive side. But if you are prepared to splurge a little, compared to a fine dining experience in Singapore, it would have been considered quite affordable.Would definitely recommend this place for an occasional celebratory dinner.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 14 March 2018 ,Tosca Trattoria Italiana at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

"sfatimahaziz195Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Terrible Service and Inconsistent Food Quality,"My family and I have been to Tosca several times since it opened and our dinner there last Saturday, 29th July 2017, would sadly be our last. The service this particular night was terrible, to say the least. We had just finished a day of shopping and decided to stop by Tosca for dinner at 9pm. The restaurant did not appear to be full although the tables by the pool were mostly occupied. Our experience that night did not reflect the fine dining standards we were used to at Tosca.- We were shown to a table that was not wiped down or prepared with cutlery or mats. I had to request for this and it took several minutes for the server to come back and clean our table and prepare it- After we placed our order, it took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. My sister ordered the braised beef ribs and were informed, after the drinks were served, that this was unavailable. She then chose the lasagne knowing that her food would probably arrive much later than mine or my mum's. - Half an hour passed and no sign of our food. We helped ourselves to the antipasto but most of it was gone and not replenished - a shame! We were eating bits and pieces of leftover antipasto, was what it felt like.- 45 minutes after our initial order, my sister was informed that the lasagne is also not available. She settled for the braised wagyu beef cheek.- Staff at the nearby bar area were piling dirty dishes in full view of customers on to the bar table. They were also talking loudly amongst themselves, completely ruining our experience and the ambiance as a whole.- A man from another table walked over to the staff at the bar demanding their drinks - his table had been waiting for a full 20 minutes without drinks. We heard the entire exchange - embarrassing! - Another 20 minutes and our food finally arrived. My mum's whole seabass had a delicious pesto sauce but the fish was under-seasoned and bland. My rib eye steak was very good and done to the proper level I requested - although I was not asked which sauce I wanted (according to the menu I had the choice of mushroom and black pepper, seems I got the black pepper anyway). My sister's wagyu was a let down as the beef did not taste fresh and she could not finish it. - It took several requests to get our water glasses refilled (we asked for the Evian and ended up consuming 2 bottles). To top it off, the total bill came to slightly over RM500 and unfortunately I was unaware of the ongoing promotion for HHonors members, for point accumulation - only found out when I stepped into the elevator and saw this advertised. The server did not bother to ask me this when she presented the bill! Incredibly disappointing to have experienced this at Tosca, as this used to be one of my favorite places in JB for a family dinner.

"prince-aaronJohor Bahru, Malaysia","service and ambience over ""authentic"" italian food","Tosca at Jb Hilton is basically the best Italian restaurant in JB.Headed by an experienced 5 star manager Jai,floor staff Natasha and flair bartender Maran.A visit here is sure to leave you lingering with memories of its warm service and uber interior.At night,the cosy ambience is best suited for dates,and business meetings.Jai the manager is very hands on with the customers overseeing smooth operations and will personally take your order as he is on the floor all the time.Natasha never stops smiling and will even sing you a song if it's your birthday.Order a cocktail and Maran will put on a show for you,and he is an equally skilled barista if your prefer coffee.The food is best described as classic itallian,The menu might not be best suited for a typical Asian palate as it is not overdone with spices.Expectations have to be tempered down taste wise as the flavours are mild at best.I can't comment on the beef as I don't consume it.An area of improvement is ensuring that the balcony doors must be closed when guests are smoking outdoor.The best way to enjoy this restaurant is the A La Carte menu.Phone in ahead of time and check if the executive chef is on duty on the day of your visit.Also enquire on the availability of the seafood and fresh produce as they do have stock supply issues at times especially for the spinach and scallops.Hope you enjoy your visit.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 14 April 2017 ,Tosca Trattoria Italiana at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

"z_c00lPenang Island, Malaysia",I would expect better....,"Clearly, this place has very nice atmosphere and service was great. But why am I giving an average rating.... read on.I checked in late to the hotel and was too lazy to have my dinner outside. So, I thought I just dropped by Tosca. I always wanted to try Tosca during my first visit, but didn't had the chance.Upon entry, I was greeted and guided to my seat. The view was perfect as well as the ambient. Menu was presented. It took me awhile to choose my selection. Waiter was very patient in answering my question. Finally orders were taken.I ordered the Seafood Soup for starters and Sirloin Steak for main. Also had fruit punch for drinks.It took awhile for the dish to arrive, but when it did, both my soup and main dish came together. I wasn't really happy with that. Were they trained in fine dining? Or am I in a cheap fine dining restaurant. How can they serve both soup and main dish at once?I told the waiter I can't have both at once. Besides, my main course would be cold by the time I finish my soup. Waiter went ahead and put my dish into the warmer.If the owner of the restaurant is reading this, kindle google ""fine dining course - the right sequence"" and train your staff.I got on with my soup...sorry to say that it was disappointing. It tasted like a cheap tomato soup boiled in with some prawns and mussel. Even the mussels were not fresh and over cooked that it shrank to tiny piece no longer edible. After a few slurps, I called for the main.I order the blackpepper sauce sirloin steak cooked medium. Again was disappointed because due to the warmer, the steak is now well-done. The sauce was mediocre. The sides were unpleasantly placed below the steak consisting of what I can remember just a few cut carrots, eggplant, capsicum. I was wondering if the garlic was meant to be eaten as well. Overall, I was disappointed with the dish knowing that I have paid a sum of money for it. I had rib eye steak at Chez Papa the next day and this dish is nowhere neat that standard.I hope someone would look into this.

"AK_travel_reviewLondon, United Kingdom",Saturday buffet experience,"The setting of the restaurant is very appealing on the 13th floor of the DoubleTree hotel with great views of either the pool or the skyline and on to Singapore. The food available on the buffet covered a variety of cold antipasti (no seafood), a freshly made pizza station, a meat station serving chicken with peppercorn sauce, a fresh pasta station and a dissertation section. This was in no way a negative experience but I was not overwhelmed either. I had some bruscetta to start, followed by a slice of pizza, pasta with mushrooms chicken and cream and a chocolate brownie. The quality of the food was good even if the tastes were a bit blunt for my liking (but I may be biased since I am a great lover of Italian cuisine and miss no opportunity to have it locally). As expected, the staff were very friendly and attentive, always eager to assist which is a huge plus.

"drinkingmiloSingapore, Singapore","Fantastic location, ambience, food and service!","If I could give them 10 stars out of 5, I would!!As usual, my boyfriend and I ordered too much, and boy, this MUST be the first time that we felt so upset about not being able to finish our food! They were simply delicious!We ordered a mushroom soup, and salad for starters (antipasto), an aglio olio (with shrimps and tiger prawns), as well as 2 pizzas. The server warned us most kindly that the pizzas are pretty big at 8 inches, but we were just too excited to care, lol!Firstly, the mushroom soup was amaaaaazing. Flavourful and yet not overpowering; one could easily finish an entire pot of it without getting queasy! Yum!As is the style with Italian restaurants, you get to have as much bread as you want! Their bread was served with 3 very interesting spreads/toppings, including what I believe to be an Indian spice. There are also 3 kinds of bread: a very fluffy white bread, a not-so-fluffy and incredibly crunchy white bread and a dense brown one. If you prefer one of them, just ask a server to bring you more of it and they were happily oblige!:)Next, the salad. The salad came with many small pieces of bacon bits, thin large slices of cheese and thin crispy slices of bread. Nothing particularly spectacular as compared to other expensive salads you may get elsewhere but definitely of top quality and taste, :). I _would_ order it again!The angel pasta was similarly amazing. Like the frutti de mare (pizza), it had the smell and taste of the sea. Absolutely fantastic! The shrimps were sweet and juicy, and tasted perfectly cooked. Not too tough, but not raw! It was quickly finished by me and my boyfriend, D: Finally, the pizzas!! Highlight of the meal!!! As mentioned, the frutti de mare had the taste of the sea. The pizzas were evenly cut, and the toppings were placed wonderfully. See the photos for yourself! The pizzas were thin crusted and crunched with every bite, slightly browned at the bottom but nowhere close to being burned. A perfect 10 out of 10!!!All in all, it was a fantastic meal, :)The price was really reasonable at around 235+ ringgit given the quality and standards, and the amount we ordered (lol).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 9 December 2016 ,Tosca Trattoria Italiana at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru
"Matthew NPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",A restaurant I had to try...,"This is one of the list of restaurants I had try while I was residing at the DoubleTree Hilton. It ranks no 5 as the top 5 restaurants to dine in Tripadvisor among 692 restaurants reviewed in Johor Bahru city.On the second last day of my stay, I came down from the 14th floor to Tosca Restaurant which is located on the 13th floor the same as the hotel's swimming pool. And yes, they not only have a view of the pool from inside the restaurant but also an Al Fresco dining area outdoors beside the pool!I was greeted at the door by the manager and led to a seat quite easily as it was a Sunday and at that time which was around 1pm, they weren't many people around except for a table with a family and a screaming little baby. (Yes, this restaurant also serves family and little kids so the screaming baby part was in no way part of the dining experience)Since I was dining alone and I still had another place restaurant to dine and review later I didn't order much to eat as I wanted to pace myself. To I would say the menu selection was rather extensive. I was informed at the start there was no pizza for the lunch that day and they would serve it during dinner. (They have their own wood oven to bake their pizza's and from what I have read, it's quite good)I opted for the Pasta Aglio Olio and a side of spinach in cheese sauce I believe. Like most fine dining restaurants like this the bread at the beginning with it's condiments was served. I would rate it as good as to me the bread was fresh and I enjoyed the herb butter.Finally I got to sample the pasta. The spaghetti that they served with the dish was what you normally find in an Italian restaurant in Malaysia. I was expecting the prawns (I believe it to be Tiger prawns) to be bigger but the size that they served me in was satisfactory. The thing about Aglio Olio is that many chefs claim that it is the simplest dish to prepare (Garlic, Olive Oil and chilli flakes) yet the hardest thing one to cook. If it's overdone as in the garlic is overcooked or the balance of garlic and chilli flakes is not right the dish doesn't come out right.I am not saying it was bad, mind you. It was Aglio Olio. But I suppose I was expecting a little more flavor? I am not a professional chef nor an amateur when it comes to pasta. I have prepared dishes like this before and my pasta's vary in taste each time I prepare Aglio Olio. It's just that the taste wasn't quite as wow as I was expecting. I have sampled pasta like this in fine dining restaurants in Thailand, Singapore, Petaling Jaya & Australia and all those times the dish had that 'wow' experience.Ok the plus point. Even though the prawns weren't really as big as I was expecting it turn out to be the hit. It had that nice after effects of being on the grill with just a hint of smokiness. Well seasoned, the prawns delivered that perfect balance in taste and texture.I also ordered a side of spinach with cheese or in cheese sauce. Now that was also fantastic. But I guess over-ordered. For a single solo diner, the helping was actually meant for 2 or 3. After all the cheese sauce adds the richness to the flavor. Overall I still rate my experience as Very Good. The service staff and the ambience certainly justifies this rating. Also I would like to take this time to credit the management of Doubletree by The Hilton., After studying the comments by reviewers here, they have taken the time to reply the reviewers professionally. In an age where there are so many 'commenters' online, this reflects the dedication to professionalism and that they take time to reply shows how serious they are about improving their service and food.It is certainly deserving of this rating and the ranking to which Tosca is in.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 30 November 2016 ,Tosca Trattoria Italiana at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

I'm a sucker for salads so if I were to be served a soggy or disgusting salad I would be on angry patron. lol However, their salad do not disappoint. I tried their antipasto. Was hoping the selection would be a bit more as I have been to Italy and I do miss trying out their cheese platter. However, their salsa verde and cracker platter complimented each other nicely so it was still okay. I have tried their steaks. Very nice. Asked for medium rare-cooked to perfection. Excellent! However I do not like their dessert. The vanilla gelato tasted quite cheap. Sorry. The tiramisu was just okay.Talking about the ambience, I do love the interior decoration. Very stylish and table seatings are all very cosy and I am happy that we all have our own privacy at every dining table.

Things to improve: our main courses were good but not great (the lamb chops were rather gristly; the trout was pan fried and too rich, although the latter may just be our taste); we weren't too impressed with the tiramisu, which was an interpretation rather than a classic recipe. But we much enjoyed our dinner and will return: there is a wide menu choice and I'm sure that we will find main courses that suit our taste.

Caryn J,Excellent service & great food,"Was there to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday. Nice ambience and it wasn't too crowded. The outdoor seating is really great for a cool evening. It is windy and has music by the pool and a great view of the city. Food is delicious. Ordered baby lobster linguine - great value for money. Baby lobster isn't that baby; it has lots of meat. Also had a wagyu steak sirloin. Fat was just right, meat was tender. Also ordered a ham and mushroom pizza. Oven toasted, the crust was thin and crispy so it doesn't fill up too much of your stomach if you want to have room for desserts. Dessert - chocolate mousse is so delicious. Initially I was worried if it would be like whipped cream but it was good! Not overly rich and semi sweet, I liked it. And most of all, the service is the thing that made the experience so good. They were attentive and when they served the birthday dessert, they even sang enthusiastically!

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia","Lovely, cozy restaurant ","My wife and I visited Tosca last night, after a brief business meeting in the DoubleTree lounge. We were looking forward to unwind with a quick light meal, with some wine. Our last visit to Tosca was a few months ago, with the kids in tow. The kids were certainly not at their best then. So, when we walked in, we were half expecting the staff there to scurry over to the lovely church next door for some holy water, while making the sign of the cross. Instead, we were asked repeatedly, ""Sir, Madame, where are the kids???"" And thus begin our night in this charming little place. I've always felt that it's difficult running a fancy restaurant. A hole-in-the wall with lovely tapas but a sulky owner will still be patronized. Ditto for a street-side cafe with lovely coffee but horrible service. In fact, South East Asia is full of eating places like that. The best food can be found in these places, and that's all that matters. When a restaurant tries to offer more, it has an uphill task of satisfying more than just tastebuds. There is the location, appearance, ambience, service, the menu, interaction with staff, etc, before we even get to the food. Tosca is modern, with classy touches, yet manages to retain a relaxing and cozy atmosphere. It's located next to the pool and has 2 main eating areas. The wine was just right while the starters were tasty and large enough to be a meal in themselves. The staff took note that we were pressed for time, so our main course arrived in quick time. Jai and his lovely crew, Alee Noor & Gretchen, kept dropping by at our table from time to time, asking if we were alright. Jai even whipped up his own signature Bruschetta, which was served to us, on the house. We found it to be absolutely delicious. Our quick meal turned out to be a drawn out affair, as we chatted merrily with the staff. Jai even made us promise to bring the kids the next time!Finally, we were surprised by the very reasonable bill. All in all, a fine effort in a fine restaurant. Job well done, Tosca.

With a single taste of the starter gratin, I had decided to order seafood gratin as my main course while she always love to have medium cooked beef with the truffle sauce.Good taste of one main course is always given the reason to regularly having the same food with same sauce for a week or a month. Chez Papa do give me the feeling of return to this restaurant again once I finished the main course. Fresh and skillful cooked of beef would be stimulated your taste bud after having bites of beef with a sip of recommended red wine. This is when you will say ‚Äúermmmm‚Äù without bothering your partner by eating continuously.Dessert and many others dishes, GO TASTE YOURSELF and I will not tell you how great experience I was in this restaurant. And....I really hope to join anyone of you in the wine bar or I called it as my living room of Chez Papa Restaurant for chit-chatting until they close.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 20 May 2019 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar
xcharisse,Authentic French restaurant and excellent wine choices,"We had their featured starter which had the salad, spring rolls and that meatball rolled with cabbage which was perfect! The avocado wasn't that ripe yet but it didn't make the experience bad at allFor our mains, we had salmon and sirloin steak. The salmon was cooked well but not overcooked, can have more potatoes though. The sirloin steak was cooked well done as I have requested and at first I was hesitant it will turn out medium rare but they cooked it just perfect. In fact, the best sirloin steak I have ever had to date! It was charred and not overly seasoned! Just superb! I will be having it next time again for sure. Dessert was chocolate mousse and creme brulee. The custard's consistency was okay, not too sweet but smooth texture and the caramelized sugar was just right to go with the custard and that chocolate mousse.. my my myyyyy! Rich dark chocolate taste but done just right to wrap up the entire food experience. We had red wine and rose and my partner then ordered another rose because it was that good. Service was excellent, love the idea that they check on your food. The Manager, Ms. Jofer (hope we got her name spelled correctly) was warm and kind from the moment we entered the restaurant.

Bob W,Ignorant service for a French Bistro,"Staff knowledge of wines is poor. Wine list does not correspond with bottle and they insist it is right. House wine can be a young wine but if a patron buys a bottle?? 2017 Sauvignon Blanc is too young to put in a wine list and the bottle is from the storeroom and not chilled, and when the waiter served it, it was still a Malaysian room temperature. I had to stop him, and they never poured the wine after that. I had to serve my guest and pour the wine from start to finish. What is the service charge for?? They also charge for bread basket. All French restaurants I have been do not charge for bread. Our bill was RM $466 for 2 persons and we only ordered one main course - go figure. Paying for bread is strange when we order 3 starters and for desserts we ordered a Cheese platter. The big dinner fork that was served with a dozen escargots was odd, you could serve it with a desert fork maybe?? Prongs were too huge for the tiny escargot. My guest was sure they would charge the cracker and bread separately for the cheese platter but it was included. The same dinner fork was used for the cheese platter. Its not acceptable to me but Trip Adviser reviews rate the restaurant amongst the top. I have been here about 5 times in the last 3 years and the reason I never reviewed it was because of the pesky fruit flies that are always present - this time there were more.

Foie gras, escargots and onion soup were yummy as well and to finish off, we had ‚Äòpavlova‚Äô - very generous serving of berries. Considering how busy the restaurant was, service was pretty good.

JoeT3041,"Chez Papa Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Perhaps the most distinctive experience Chez Papa offers is the certain je ne sai quoi with which one would bowl over after an epicurean night.To many, and not surprising, Chez Papa is the authentic French restaurant par excellence in JB. Founded by both a gastronome and oenophile, the owners, also a couple, together with their team are petits soins with the guests' dining experience. Divided into two separate sections, one may want to dine en famille or shoptalk with business associates in the fine-dining section. Other than the French haute cuisine, from the crispy and creamy p√¢t√® de foie gras seared to perfection, to the choice beef served au naturel or with the special homemade gravy, Chez Papa also has other non-French varieties to cater to the catholic tastes of the guests. One's appetite would not be sated without the banana flamb√© √† la mode. Do check out the plaits du jour.Coterminous with the lack-of-flannel fine-dining section within the same boundary, the other section is embellished in a rococo style, smack of belle √©poque of a French bistro in a sui generis, grotto setting yet salubrious, and would surely ensorcell you with a tinge of douceur de vivre. This is a great place to rendezvous, be it with your inamorata or inamorato or friends, where one may find artistic savoir faire irrelevant (Nota Bene - this is a smoking section where kids may be OB. You may also choose to dine here- 3 dining tables available-where reservation is suggested ). You may lounge yourself here in the sofa, or sit by the bar counter, or tryst with a glass of wine in a nook.The m√©lange of wines and imported beers, in draught or bottles, here would not disappoint the wine bibbers and wassailers.

"Tiv62Boston, Massachusetts",A culinary gem that stands alone in JB,"Since my very first trip to JB there is one restaurant that is a must, Chez Papa. This moderately sized French restaurant in the middle of JB serves the best food in the area bar none. The escargot is delicious and well prepared, and if you're willing to spend a bit more the Wagyu rib-eye was phenomenal and perfectly cooked. Overall though the food is extremely well priced for the quantity and the quality (try the Poulet Cordon Bleu), and I have never left Chez Papa anything less than fully satisfied. Speaking of satisfied, the service at Chez Papa is fantastic. After only my first visit the staff knew not only that I had been there previously, but called me a cab and remember the hotel that I was staying at. They even remembered my favorite beer!

"CaseyyykcSingapore, Singapore",Best Restaurant in JB - be it the food or the service! thumbs up!!,"Brought boyf there for his birthday dinner as he has been wanting to try out this place. Made a reservation through email and they have promptly reply within 24hrs! Location is near Pelangi Mall (along the road side) - and there's a boutique hotel next to it. Direction is heading back to Woodlands custom. The shop doesn't stand out too loud as compared to the colorful boutique hotel but still, you won't missed it as the typical French Flag colors is part of the signboard. It's not too far from JB custom, should probably take you about 10mins to get there by car.Food was definitely awesome! Foie Gras at its best! my boyf ordered their Signature Steak which was good, I've ordered the Poulet cordon bleu that win hands down! it's a must try! The oven baked chicken is rolled up with turkey ham & cheese, with the slight taste of cordon bleu inside it. totally mind-blown! The fries is served separately so that they don't turn soggy after awhile. YUMSYUMS! if you're not a big eater like me, finishing the poulet cordon bleu might be a challenge (PS: we had appetizer as well) so you might want to share, the food is too good to get wasted! Service was one of the best - i never felt so sincerely served by waitress/waiter before which they ensure that we had our drinks refill promptly and to ensure that the plates were cleared off once we are done. Constantly checking us out to see if we are satisfied with the dishes. Apart from their standard menu, they also have a ""portable"" surprise menu - oh boy! too much choices!VISA machine was down that night but luckily they do accept AMEX. Just in case if you didn't bring enough cash, you might want to bring the 2 types of credit card along with you. After the meal you can get the staff to call a cab for you to get to your next destination. i'll definitely be back again! gonna bring my family and other friends along this time!

madfish1Singapore,Authentic French Casual Dining in the heart of JB,"Our party of 16 were on our way back to Singapore from Legoland by Coach and decided to stop over for dinner at French Bistro and Wine Bar, Chez Papa. Located very near to Pelangi Mall, this unassuming bistro has a boutique hotel and a spa for neighbours.When we approached the location of the bistro, it was drizzling and we had an elderly in the form of my 84 year old dad and several young ones including my 4 month old daughter Eva on board but we could not get close to the front of bistro because a badly parked vehicle blocked our coach's way. My sister decided to walk to the bistro to ask if there was another way in but co-owner Shereen decided it was easier to ferry the oldest and youngest using her car instead.When we entered the bistro and wine bar, we were greeted by a warm and cosy ambience which its French co-owner Dominique proudly informed had been decorated by none other than himself. My favorite part of the establishment was undoubtedly the wine bar area which was furnished with one-of-a-kind solid wood tables, unique armchairs and even a 20 year old tapestry made of wood. I lack the adjectives to describe the place, but cosy, warm, homey may offer some guidance. You gotta see the place for yourself to understand what I mean.Anyway, on to the more important thing to me...Food, Food came quickly and it was a feast!The delish Soup de Bois (mushroom soup) was rustic yet subtle, something only the French can do. The foie gras chaud was perfectly cooked and escargots de bourgogne were sooooo good, I couldn't resist the garlic butter sauce in which the snails were cooked, so I dabbed at it with the freshly toasted bread.Quiche is not my favourite food but the piece of Quiche de jour I took from a shared platter was quite nice.I had an tender juicy off-the-menu fillet mignon perfectly done to my required medium rare and topped with a yummy black pepper sauce. My wife had the Poulet Cordon Bleu and reported that it was ""really very good"". The rest had a variety of mains like the salmon, ribeye and sirloin steaks. i didn't ask them how they found their meals as i was too busy stuffing my face but i only saw empty plates after dinner, by which time we were all groaning from overeating and decided to pass on dessert except for my 2 year old daughter who was initially suspicious of their chocolate mousse and rasberry mousse combo (ok, I confess, I'm not a dessert person so I had about as much interest in it as...um...a cow would have for a piece of roast chicken!There was this side dish of thinly sliced fried potato skins lightly salted that was simply fab. I was away from the table when it arrived but since it was conveniently placed within my arm's length, I ""gasak-ed"" what was left in no time at all. It was so thinly sliced and so light and oil-less yet crunchy, I could whack a few bags of that stuff in one sitting...easily!But I must leave my best comment on food for the absolutely delicious tartiflette, a gratin comprising potato slices, reblochon cheese, salt, pepper and a little paprika powder. The dish apparently originates from the Savoie and Haute Savoie regions of France. I was impressed enough with it to ask chef et restaurateur for the recipe and he generously obliged. Although their version does not contain lardon (a type of bacon) due to the kitchen being pork free, their version was nevertheless very tasty. The secret, according to Dominique is in the Reblochon cheese (which comes from the Savoie and Haute Savoie areas) as he firmly declared that it had to be Reblochon cheese or nothing at all.The bistro carries wines from several countries but this is French bistro and Shereen's recommendation (her's and Dominique's personal favourite) of the Cheval Noir was spot on. This Saint Emilion offering was true to the style of its originating region. This refined, well balanced classy merlot driven wine offered silky tannins, delicious fresh berry fruits and a hint of spice (ok, trying to show off a bit of the stuff I learnt at a wine course). It was lovely on the nose, easy on the palate and has you wanting more. Greedy me had more than I really should have, but well, I wasn't driving so I can be forgiven for indulging.I must also reserve praise and thanks to Shereen and Dominique for their warm reception and hospitality. We left with a warm glow and satisfied (if heavy) tummies! I am resolved to buy a GPS so I can find my way back there again. But for now, its back to reality and the diet my doctor has been trying to persuade me to conform to.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 12 November 2015 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Still the best!,"I have been visiting Chez Papa since 2001, when it was only known among a small circle of folks in Jb. Later, after I got married, the Wife and I came more frequently. The Wife is vegetarian. I remember still how Shereen would come to our table and discuss how she could make us a vege dish. But mostly, we used to go for drinks and dessert, sometimes with friends from around the world, all of whom would be impressed with this restaurant. I've hesitated to write about Chez Papa before, because of my limited exposure to authentic (stress on 'authentic') French food and dining. Now, after 2 recent visits to France, and having dined there in some fine restaurants, I think I'm in a better position to leave a review. I visited for dinner with The Wife and niece on 6/7/15. We sat near the bar area and had wonderful service from the wait staff. We started off with bread and a bottle of Cote du Rhone white wine. We had the sampler platter of quiche, tuna and cold salad with sliced duck, which was wonderful. The dish was almost a meal of it's own. Mains were grilled fish for me, and a chicken roll of sorts for the niece. The Wife had the cheese platter with 5 types of cheese. We were quite full, and shared a crepe suzette for dessert, the preparation of which was quite interesting! We ended up having a carafe of house-pouring white wine before we left. The bill was RM505.00. We had an excellent time. This restaurant has only one real rival in JB, and that's Tosca at DoubleTree.

"Eucalyptus70Singapore, Singapore",Quaint and charming in its own unique way!,"Yes its old and stayed the same all these years. Yes its located at a less than fancy location. Yes its 'gloomy' But are all these external aesthetics important? Its the food that matters mind you!We have been patrons of Shereen and Dominique for more than 10 years and have seen the evolution of the restaurant - bare and functional to quaint and charming. It is filled to the brim with odd knicks and knacks the couple has collected from their numerous travels. We appreciate the little touches that defines a restaurant's character. Who cares about chi chi modern decor when obviously Chez Papa does not aspire to be! Our family shared a meal over 10 different dishes last week. It was absolutely memorable and we had such a wonderful time. The French onion soup is out of this world. There is an undertone hint of burnt onions that add a wonderful dimension to the soup. And this is achieved with a 15 year old oven that is sort of falling apart. But it imparts a distinctive taste that's uniquely Chez Papa. Best foie gras as well. Believe me, I have eaten at really expensive fine dining restaurants in Singapore but it still cannot do an honest job of this piece of delicacy. The Plats Du Jour featured a pan fried salmon dish and the meat was so buttery and soft. We guessed it was sous vide and pan fried lightly. Each dish was perfectly executed and we were astonished it was achieved in a very small and basic kitchen. Its the skill that matters! We cannot find such wholesome French food at this price where we live - expensive Singapore. Singapore has tons of swanky restaurants but that is not the point here. Chez Papa holds its own and should be proud of its character and heritage. I see no reason why it should even pay attention to diners whose opinions are superficial at best.Everyone should appreciate the restaurant and its food and for what it stands for.

"bluelight77Dallas, Texas",A much needed gem in this city!,"I recently dined at Chez Papa with my family. There was a certain cosy ambience when you walk into the restaurant which made it so much less intimidating. We were greeted by our server (Ivy) who told us politely to wait at the bar while they prepared the table for us (we were early for our reservation). After one sip of their House French Cabernet, our table was ready. we had a party of four which included my 7 year old son. We enjoyed the foie gras appetizer very much. We also had some mushroom soup and french onion soup. the latter being alittle too sweet for my taste. I ordered the Wagyu Ribeye special, my mother had the Dover Sole, my brother had the seafood pasta and my son had the linguine with chicken. Everyone enjoyed their entrees. My steak was done closer to the rare side which is actually perfect as I ordered it medium rare. And since the cut was thinner than usual, it made for a satisfying meal. Ivy and the rest of the wait staff were very hospitable and we finished off our dinner with some banana flambe and crepe suzette (which my son devoured).I definitely recommend Chez Papa and look forward to going again.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 27 December 2014 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

Have had food here before and this time was superb as always..Shared the fois gras as a starter. It was sooo good and the sauce/reduction they used is out of this world. Also had their Chez Papa sampler which is a Xmas special - lovely morsels of food to nibble on.For mains we had the lamb tenderloin which was cooked to perfection. Again the accompanying sauce was very good.. And chef made some off the Xmas menu mains for the kids which they really enjoyed.Although too full for desert, Shereen insisted we try the chocolate flourless cake, lemon sorbet and the creme brulee - all of which were so darn good. The lemon sorbet was slightly tart and very refreshing. Almost tempted to ask for a shot of vodka - would have been a perfect complement to it.The entire family enjoyed the meal tremendously.

Overall the night was good however in my opinion the food and drinks were a little over priced. The total bill came to RM1,000, which when compared to other quality Asian restaurants, this, in my opinion, was a tad too expensive for what you got and to warrant a second visit.The d√©cor presented a very casual ‚Äòcafe‚Äô style look rather than a luxury up-market look. While the food and wine were expensive, it was still quite nice though as it did provide a relaxed atmosphere to eat and socialise with friends.The staff were very friendly, although it did take an extraordinarily long period of time to serve up our main meals. When the mains finally arrived they were very nice, albeit my steak was a little under-cooked. I ordered my steak medium-rare, however it came out rare. I could have sent it back, but thought I may end up eating alone when the others had finished their meals. In fairness to the restaurant, they did offer a liquor and coffee as compensation for the long delay in serving the meals.Overall it was a pleasant night, reasonably good food, but a tad expensive for the style of restaurant when compared to other up-market restaurants in the JB area.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 14 September 2014 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

"TheRainInJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Top notch,"The best western food that we've had in JB. Highlights were the rack of lamb and the fillet steak (both specials of the day) which were superb. For starters we had the salad of the day (excellent) and the snails, which were tasty but a little small. We shared a creme brulee for dessert, which was good although lacked topping...better that way than having the caramel armour plating often seen in restaurants, but could have done with a little more. Excellent wine list - we chose the Argentinian Trapiche Malbec, which was superb. The area is pretty commercial - a busy sliproad - and the decor is not terribly inspiring but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We found the service to be excellent - the owner looked after us very well and spotted that the lamb was underdone when we cut into it and whisked it away to the kitchen from where it reappeared perfectly cooked a couple of minutes later. BTW if you arrive by car then they will park your car for you, which is very helpful given how busy the area is. Reading an earlier review regarding the thickness of the steaks, I would say that ours was a good sized (and thick) piece of meat.

The problem is that we were able to clearly see those names from the board, while what we wanted was the description or explanation of those dishes. By the way, merely changing forks, spoons and plates did not grant one better services.Last, regarding the taste, they served the worst pumpkin soup from my experiences. Papa's selection was just normal and the pasta was overwhelmed by unflavored creamy taste. Crepes with ice cream were below average. The only thing that could be conveniently edible was a dessert named 'Colonel', which was a lemon sorbet soaking in Vodka.For the total damages of RM 100+ for two persons, only atmosphere was ok for that night.

"SalsaAramSan Francisco, California",Perfect Restaurant for Our Anniversary!,"We had booked our reservation with Chez Papa after seeing that it was the #1 restaurant in all of Johor. We are here for our anniversary and wanted to celebrate in an intimate, and romantic, restaurant. We didn't want a huge impersonal restaurant interfering with the feeling and the atmosphere. Jill has lived in France and loves French food so this was the perfect choice!We feel in love with Chez Papa the second we walked in. It is so quaint and the decor is wonderful. Dominique, the owner, has put a lot of time and effort into making the interior calm, fun and it feels as if you are walking into a classy French bistro. We sat at a table that was nice and simple. We ordered a fairly priced rose from France and had that with the 5 cheese plate. Delicious and a great start to the evening. For the entre we had steak with peppercorn sauce and I had chicken stuffed with mushrooms in a cream sauce. Both had sides of vegetables and potato mash. Simply said: AMAZING. We could not believe how good it was. Usually, when I go to eat, I remember the first few bites and the last few bites. Not this time. Every single bite had more flavor and made us remember what it is like to eat food that is made with love by the chef.We then had desert and a glass of brandy each. We were full but we were not going to pass these by as the night was special and we wanted to truly celebrate and enjoy every second of it.Dominique, who we had watched bring food out during dinner, give advice to staff, and make sure everything was perfect, stopped by and asked us how we were doing. We thanked him and told him that this was the perfect dinner for our anniversary. The rest of the staff always smiled, was friendly and the service was excellent.Honestly, we can not think of a restaurant we have enjoyed more at this point. We will go back again for another meal before we leave as we know we will have a hard time finding a restaurant this good soon.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 29 October 2013 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

Although the cod was quite tasty, I didn't enjoy the vegetables comprising 3 pieces of sugar snap peas, 3 small thin slices of carrots, a small portion of red cabbage, a dollop of coleslaw and half a roast potato. Most of the grilled vegetables were over cooked and looked uninviting. Considering the size of the cod, I find the price to be a tad expensive at Rm68++.Overall we would rate our meals as average.

"PinkAddictKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Didn't Meet Expectations. Sad to be the one to give this review but want to share my experience,"Having trusted TripAdvisor for a while now when planning my trips, I made sure I dropped by this restaurant bec of the rave reviews. I even booked the boutique hotel beside it thinking that we could at least get a decent meal while our short stay in Johor (since I was bringing my daughter to see Legoland). Also, let me note that I live in KL and spend summers in France for the past 9 years, hubby is French -- so I had high hopes for this French restaurant when we went there.I booked dinner for my family, True enough the waiters were friendly and smiling when we entered. I do not doubt that they are eager to serve. However, all things got dampened when I ordered the FOIE GRAS. It came with some salad and after I ate the first bite of the foie gras and a piece of the cherry tomato, I noticed something moving -- and i mean MOVING and WRIGGLING -- on my plate! It was a little worm! The waitress quickly came after I called her and I asked her if she can see the wiggly thing. She muttered ""sorry"" then took the plate away. When she came back, she said it must be from the salad. I would expect at this point that the chef would come to apologize -- no I didn't get that. She just said here this one no more moving stuff inside. Hmm... seemed very unapologetic to me. I would think they should give it for free after that horrible experience ... i wanted to throw up after that but held it together because I did not want to ruin the evening (which started badly). The mushroom soup was good -- that I can vouch for it. The rest of the food was okay. Nothing fantastic. I had the steak, which was okay and a bit dry for my taste. Hubby took some chicken with mushroom and he liked it. While my mother (whom I was entertaining as well bec she came to visit me in Malaysia as my guest) had the grilled lamb which I found a bit hard but didn't want to complain. In the end, I was disappointed that I did not have a formal apology... nor an offer to discount that silly item with wriggly worm. They took the plate away too fast for me to take a pic! When the dinner was done, my mom kept wondering if they will give the foie gras for free since they didn't come to formally apologize... and she couldn't hold her tongue and told the waiter ""No free dessert?"" when I asked for the bill. I guess they felt guilty about what happened and did come with some free dessert (after being prompted). I did come back the second evening -- simply because of convenience. My daughter and mother were tired after Legoland so they stayed at the hotel while hubby and I went back to Chez Papa to get some soup and a quiche for a light dinner. We tried the different wing of the restaurant (the bar part) which I find was better atmosphere albeit some mosquitoes flying around. We had a forgetful waiter who did not come with our bread -- and had to remind him 4 x before we got it... then the waitress from the other evening came to serve our soup jokingly told me ""Dont worry there is nothing moving in there"" -- not sure what to make of that... funny? or not? We ordered some cheese which hubby found very reasonably priced (that is one good thing about them).. however we felt overlooked bec the owner and chef were bust with their ""regulars"" and seem to have forgotten us ... and our need for bread to eat with the cheese. I even finished my soup sans the bread -- which our forgetful waiter said was coming... sigh. I guess we were the lucky ones who encountered some kind of incident at the restaurant. I just think they need to improve their customer relations when it comes to incidents like this.For me, not sure if I would bother to go back there the next time I am in Johor to bring my daughter to Legoland. Will probably try other places. If not for the convenience beside the boutique hotel, I would give this place a miss and try to find other gems in Johor.Oh... and my honest opinion on their atmosphere -- i guess some people find the place charming which I do not contest bec those are personal tastes. As for me, I found the place very old, in need of upgrading. If you look up the ceiling you can see they didn't bother fixing it properly and tried to cover with some cloth... the interior could benefit from some fresh paint and some upgrading.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 27 November 2012 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

Nayoung_VDEAmsterdam,Great atmosphere,"The staff is super friendly and attentive, the bistro and wine bar are very cozy and lovely for spending time with your family or friends. The staff and decor give this place a lot of charm.The food was good, slightly hit & miss. Starters - The onion soup was very tasty, however the cocquilles (scallops and prawns) were under-seasoned and overcooked. Mains - The filet mignon was nice and tender, however my lamb tenderloins were well done while I asked for medium. We had to wait for our mains around 45 minutes, which we didn't mind too much and the staff did keep us informed and apologized for the delay. The overall dining experience however was very nice and I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.

Ate in here with my wife and two young children whilst we stayed in a hotel close by.We had a wide mixture of starters and a couple of mains and all of it was excellent. Escargot - excellent, wild mushroom soup - my wife absolutely loved it. Kids split a wonderful steak which my daughter devoured, and I had a Chicken Roulade special that was very tasty. Beers and soft drinks during the meal, coffee, port and a cheese platter to finish it off, and we just broke thru the 300 MYR barrier for a bill.

"FoodLoverJJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Must Try Authentic French Cuisine,"This is not my first time to Chez Papa. But this time I get to eat many varieties as I brought my family of 4 there, together with my uncle from UK. It is my dad‚Äôs treat for my uncle.We ordered four starters. All four quickly satisfy our taste bud. First two starters served were the mushroom soup and ceasar salad. The homemade mushroom soup has just the right thickness, lots of tiny bits of mushrooms, and cooked with their secret recipe soup stock, which made the soup delicious.The Ceasar Salad is the best Ceasar salad I have ever had. And I am not the only person who says this. I have a few friends who strongly recommend this. I don‚Äôt really know what ingredients and sauces are used to prepare this salad, but I have been to many western restaurants, but trust me, I have never tasted a Ceasar salad like the one in Chez Papa. Must Try.The next two starters served were the escargot and foie gras, which French specialty. No one should miss these in an authentic French restaurant. My husband, who always complained about the unpleasant smell/taste in foie gras served by all other restaurants, loved the foie gras from Chez Papa!My favorite main dishes include vegetarian spaghetti, sirloin steak, tuna steak and the wagyu beef. The vegetarian spaghetti is served with fresh mixed vegetables and herbs in a light cream sauce. Not too heavy, not too light. Tastes just right.Pan-seared sirloin steak with Chez Papa‚Äôs signature pepper cream sauce. How can we miss this in Chez Papa? According to the chef, their steak is not frozen, but chilled ‚Äì means that more moisture is retained in the meat. Served with their own-made pepper cream sauce, the steak is probably something you have not tried before anywhere else ;)I seldom see tuna steak served in western restaurant, and this one is a must try, as it was medium rare cooked (just nice) and served with their own-made sauce. It was soft on the inside, but kind of crisp on the outside, because it was well-pen-fried. Oh, did I forget to mention that Chez Papa main chef is specialized in sauce ‚Äì all their sauces are own-made and trust me, they all taste great! Their sauces are not like all other western restaurant ‚Äì either black pepper sauce or mushroom sauce, and some uses canned ready-made sauce‚Ä¶ those are just too common‚Ä¶By the way, if you see their menu, you won‚Äôt see some dishes like tuna steak and wagyu beef. Because they are not available every day, indeed they will have daily ‚ÄòSPECIALS‚Äô written separately on a big chalk board. Be sure to look at the chalk board also for the special dishes with limited availability.Desserts always drive me crazy. I don‚Äô know how they make these, but I simply love the flourless chocolate cake and their homemade walnut ice-cream. So full in the stomach and so full with satisfaction. My uncle had only good comments also. Chez Papa is the perfect restaurant for delicious food, good ambience and good service (this is always important for my dining experience), especially if you want to treat someone a good meal. Great for business associates, couples and family. Thank you Chez Papa for giving us a wonderful dining experience.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 6 October 2012 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

The chef, who is a native French from Nice, was at the bar chatting with some regulars and overall created a nice little ambience. We had some conversation as well and it was most certainly pleasant. The food, needless to day, was quite amazing. I had their signature escargot, which was delightful to say the least. Their onion soup was fabulous and the main course, which was duck breast with special pepper sauce, was very good. The duck could have been more moist, but the sauce redeemed it. Very tasty.I had their house wine, which came in a carafe (half a bottle size). It was a Merlot and was quite average. A better wine could better compliment the fabulous food, so I'll pick a nice bottle of Rhone from their menu instead next time.I'm not sure if you can find a restaurant in JB with better ambience and food than Chez Papa.

"seantay2Angeles City, Philippines",A Gem in Johor Bahru's Restaurant Scene.,"Was looking for a nice place for dinner besides the usual seafood and hawker haunts and saw all the fantastic reviews here so decided to give it a try. We were promptly seated upon arrival in the cosy dining area which resembled a traditional family-style inn, with ceilings adorned with aprons from all over the world contributed by their guests.Besides the standard menu, we were presented with a board of the day's specials that had a list almost as long as the standard one. The cuisine here can be defined as rustic, traditional and no-nonsense French bistro cuisine, minus the loads of cream and butter. For starters, we had a dozen of the Escargots a la Bourguignonn in their shells. Would say it was the favourite dish of mine that night and was mopping up all the buttery and garlicky goodness with the baguette provided. Next we had the Duo of Foie Gras (hot and cold) that was accompanied by cute thin toasts and a refreshing salad to cut the richness.For mains, the Pan-roasted Cod was well-executed and the skin was really crisp (quite a feat since the cod came resting with the skin on the bottom and the lemon butter sauce on the flesh side. The fish was moist and perfectly cooked without being too heavy for an oily fish like cod. Love the accompanying coleslaw. Can't put my finger on it but it had a rather unique texture and mouthfeel. Not the kind of coleslaw that is watery and dripping of diluted-mayo from old slaw that has sat in a plastic tub for days. The Pepper Steak came in a large serving and was thoughtfully pre-sliced to accommodate us since we were sharing. This was accompanied by a warm corn salsa and a rather unique version of sauerkraut spiked with cumin that stood up to the heavy flavors of the steak. Both the mains were bulked up by potatoes (as I like it), but what I really adored about it was that it was not accompanied by chips (or fries). They were boiled/baked/ sauteed with spices like paprika and herbs. Nice, waxy and flavorful alternative to commercial frozen bags that had been pre-fried in a factory. Had 'The Ultimate' which was a sampler platter of their dessert courses and included a Chocolate Mousse, Creme Brulee, Chocolate Fondant and homemade Walnut Ice-Cream. Great for people who can't decide over dessert. We proceeded to the adjoining Wine Bar for after-dinner drinks and had a great time chatting with Dominique and Shereen till after hours. We all had a fantastic time and experience.This place is a hidden gem and I would gladly cross the border (yes, I am from Singapore) just for a meal there. Service was excellent, ambience was great, good wine list (affordable too) and food that is unpretentious, and prepared only possible with heart, soul and dedication.

"MrTatlerSingapore, Singapore",Totally won me over with the delicious food and excellent ambience,"The moment i reached Chez Papa, i've noticed that the they have gave the shop front a makeover . Now it gives a much more authentic french ambience even before stepping in.This is my third or forth time dining at Chez Papa but what really prompt me to write this review is after tasting the speciality of Chez Papa - foie gras.(goose liver)I must first explain myself. I used to dislike foie gras. To me, foie gras is an expensive yet disgusting,smelly piece of animal organ. Been to a few other restaurants which serve good food but NONE is able to change my opinion on foie gras. I have concluded in the past that it must be an acquired taste - like durian and smelly tofu.Now, Chez Papa really prove that great chef exist in this town of Johor Bahru. Chez Papa manage to transform the pieces of foie gras into heavenly flavoured food.Crispy on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside, literally melt in your mouth. Imagine eating your favourite ice cream but without the coldness that hurts your teeth.Stepping InIts a Friday evening, a very busy night at Chez Papa. My wife and i are promptly brought to a table at one corner where we can a little privacy. Its a little short handed in the restaurant but the waitresses maintain their composure,mannerism and always wearing a smile whenever a customer has a request. The menu, drinking water and bread and margarine came late to my table but its forgivable as they did apologize for the slight slowness in attending to us.StartersMy wife ordered a fruity drink which she simply loves it. Then came the mushroom soup. Very yummy, full of rich flavours and can really taste pieces of mushroom. Personally i would prefer the pieces mushroom to be slightly bigger to have the ""bitey"" taste while savoring the soup.Next Escargots, must try also. The snails are prepared with a very healthy portion of olive oil and herbs. Chewy yet soft. the fragrant linger in your mouth for a while even after the piece of food is on its way down your oesophagus. Foie Gras At first, i still have doubts whether Chez Papa can satisfy my taste for foie gras. My wife just say, if its not nice - she will pay for the bill. Hey great deal for me . Anyway my wife cheated as she tasted these morsels from heaven before me with another friend. Need i say more who foot the bill? :) please remember to order this before your main course.Main courseWe ordered sirloin and chicken porcini . For the beef dish, i like the way its made. crispy along the edges, soft,tender and juicy on the inside. Chez Papa only use chilled beef and not frozen ones. For many of us who dine out will immediately notice the difference.The chicken porcini (chicken with mushroom) is very nice as well. The sauce simply differs from the standard pepper/mushroom cream/cream sauce available in other restaurant. Chicken meat is not overcook and the tenderness is well preserved, through the marvelous culinary skills of the chef.We didn't order desserts as we are kinda full after stuffing ourselves with the great food.If you are in JB and want to impress your other half, Chez Papa is the place to go.Thanks sherine and dominiq for the wonderful dining experience!!!!PS: the photos uploaded are taken with my mobile phone.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 4 July 2011 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

"DupermanSouth Australia, Australia",My blogpost on Chez Papa as an entry for sharing,"Everyone's life is different, because it's filled with personal experiences. My recent personal experience was a 'staycation' in Johore Bahru. During the 'staycation', we decided to reward ourselves with some good food. And so, a simple search lands us in Johore Bahru's most raved-about restaurant - Chez Papa French Bistro. Chez Papa French Bistro is a restaurant located near Plaza Pelangi. Therefore, in terms of its location, it was well-placed to capture the sights of both Malaysians and Singaporeans. Afterall, you can't miss this restaurant along a busy road and within walking distance to a shopping mall.We ordered a total of 3 items - escargots (half a dozen), cordon bleu, and sirloin steak. Escargots tasted yummy, mainly because of the herbs and oil they used. Cordon bleu was stuffed with chicken, turkey, ham and cheese, and was complimented with pasta as a side-dish. I would rate this as the best dish for the evening, for the fact that it was it wasn't easy to master a delicious dish that will not dis-integrate with so much meat stuffed and well-wrapped. Sirlion steak was just a tat above average. It failed to impress because the steak was medium-rare in the centre and medium-done at the sides.The total damage was MYR 121 (SGD 52.16). I figured that it wasn't exactly cheap, considering that we are on the cheaper side of the Causeway. But well, I can proudly boast to tell the world that I have tried the #1 restuarant in JB. I can only figure out 1 reason why this is the #1 restaurant - the rest of the restaurants in JB are simply mediocre, for this restaurant will merge into the crowd if it enters the Singapore market. Although I can't exactly figure out this restaurants comes up tops amongst 37 resturants, it still remains a fans-favourite such that the waiter had to turn down guests who did not make any reservations, for the resturant was full.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 10 August 2010 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar
WillTravelForFood82Singapore,Not worth the effort - If it's for the food,"I travelled from Singapore to JB's Chez Papa as it was ranked the no.1 restaurant on Tripadvisor. Am not sure why this place was ranked so highly, and given that I went to the restaurant 3 days after the last review...It is as though we went to different restaurants.The setting of the restaurant was delightful and cozy. Stepping in, it felt like being teleported into the French countryside. Considering the noise and dust outside and the instant transformation within, the feeling is almost surreal. I might have visited the restaurant too early, went at 6p.m. and there were no other patrons. In fact, it was only midway through my meal, did the staff begin turning on the lights and the music. So perhaps the reason for the less-than satisfactory meal was because...the chef wasn't there yet? But they did say they are open from 6p.m...and I didn't get an early patron discount on my bill...hmphThe staff were delightful and warm. No quibbles about the service...But the food...the food.The bread was the first to arrive on the table, and it was great! Soft, fluffy and crunchy at the right places. I was primed for a gastronomical treat...so I ate only a little bread, hoping to leave sufficient space for what was to come...So you can imagine my disappointment when the onion soup (which was supposed to be their better dishes according to the waiter), turned out weird. Now, some burnt bits would give the soup character, but the cheese floating in the soup was so charred, that the soup left a smoky and bitter aftertaste.The fillet mignon was a generous portion of meat covered with some sauce and vegetables. And there is nothing dainty about the meat. It was just so thick, and hard that my fingers on both hands were aching from all that slicing. Might have helped if the cutlery were sharper.The sauce and vegetables were alright, not spectacular, but ok. In the end, I think I might not have been served by The Chef. Did not confirm the thought, so as to leave some hope for future visits. Punishment for showing up too early...I guess. Or perhaps the restaurant is actually meant to be a good place to romance that special someone, and sip vintage wines amidst thoughtful conversation...Just not for the food.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 1 August 2010 ,Chez Papa French Bistro and Wine Bar

"hobyoSingapore, Singapore",Sincere and sublime French Cuisine that warms your heart but doesnt harm the pocket,"Coming from a Singaporean who seldom thinks twice when embarking on a fine dining adventure... I was extremely curious to find out how fine dining in the heart of Johor Bahru would be like - I was extremely disappointed at myself for construing a preconceived stereotype because Chez Papa threw all of that out of the window.Conveniently located along Jalan Jaya (2 mins walk from Plaza Pelangi - a popular mall in JB all cab drivers would know) the exterior of the restaurant was definitely in need of a make over - but I have second thoughts as well - its best to stay that way so I will not have to worry about making reservations in the future!There are 2 sides to the restaurant - a Wine bar and a proper sit down dining space.Service - be prepared to be served by approachable, friendly and unassuming staff who want to serve you the best dinner you can have.Ambience ‚Äì you will not feel like you are in the heart of JB. Enough said. =)Menu ‚Äì the dinner menu on Chez Papa‚Äôs website are evergreen items. Once you settle down in the restaurant, a hand written menu on a board will present to you what's in stall for the week ‚Äì specials which you have to be there to find out for yourself! The dessert menu comes in the same format as well.Wine / Drinks ‚Äì a fairly extensive menu but we did not try it so no comments, although Chez Papa was having a champagne special at an very reasonable price.Food ‚Äì French onion soup ‚Äì 9/10 - as good as it can get, whilst I never liked the cheese and bread on top of the soup, it is supposed to be authentic.Foie Gras with reduced port wine sauce ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì extremely savory and seared wonderfully, signature reduced port wine sauce a great way to bring out the flavors.Lamp Loin Cutlets ‚Äì 10/10 ‚Äì when grilled to perfection the lamb fuses nicely with the fats, it screams ‚ÄúLamb! / Heaven! / Wow!‚Äù in your mouth, there are few words which can aptly describe it so I shall stop at here.Mignon with Truffles ‚Äì 10/10 ‚Äì generous, balanced and zero chewiness (no bubble gum effect at all) even when I had it grilled to medium. It was that good. Sauce was slightly salted though.Cr√®me Brulee ‚Äì 8/10 ‚Äì it disappeared before I could try it so I can only evaluate it based on when it arrived in front of my partner.Banana Flamb√© ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì prepared in front of your eyes this was something new to me and I absolutely loved it.Poulet Cordon Bleu ‚Äì 10/10 ‚Äì we had this going in a second night in a row and it is definitely worth mentioning. Its oven baked, subtle crispiness, wonderfully married and absolutely difficult to find another place which whips this up better.

"IshDewynKL, Malaysia","Nice, but not as great as everyone makes it out to be","This place was highly recommended by friends, so it was with great expectations that I finally went with them one evening.The onion soup was excellent. I would go back again just for that. The steak was flavoursome, but I couldn't say it was outstanding. Other friends were very happy with their appetizers and entrees as well. However, the cheese platter (3 or 5 types of cheese) was terribly disappointing as the wording on the menu had me expecting artisan cheeses or something alone the line, but what came out were tiny portions of supermarket-variety cheeses. Considering the price, I could've walked over to the supermarket one block down and have gotten a whole block of the same stuff for just as many dollars.The desserts were not impressive either. We had a chocolate mousse, chocolate fondant and creme brulee. The mousse was more of a ganache, it was so dense! The fondant was nowhere near as oozing as it should be, and the creme brulee was rather bland. The decor was rather kitschy and hardly up to par with one's expectations of a classic French restaurant. However, it was extremely comfortable, the staff were remarkably friendly and the service quick and efficient. We were so comfortable that we ended up having a 4-hour dinner!I would not recommend this for anyone intending to propose, per say, but it is a rather nice place for a ""nice"" dinner out.

Spoilt_TravellerSingapore,Weekend High Tea Buffet,"After 4 years of being a regular guest at the hotel, I finally tried their weekend high tea buffet and was extremely satisfied with the table service, spread of local food cooked to high standards and the pleasant dining environment. There‚Äôs food for every type of diner including the kids who will enjoy the ice cream and condiments counter. One favourite of mine was the mutton satay. The chicken satay was tasty but dry. Mutton had a good balance of fat and meat. Another must try is the fried carrot cake which, when cooked by the right chef, is better than my favourite fried carrot cake in Singapore. Do try the deep fried sesame puff ball if available. The executive chef- Chef Aizeit had wisely focused on excellence with the local spread as opposed to other hotels that try to ‚Äúadd value‚Äù but end up with a mediocre international offering.Some areas of improvement is to have ala minute rotis and naans at the restaurant instead of pre-baking them and let it slowly become chewy in the claypot. Also, the beef used in the beef stew can be less lean to avoid being dried from the prolonged braising. By the way, I enjoyed the bowl of boiled green peas offered with the beef stew. Whether with the beef stew sauce or on its own, those frozen peas were well cooked and seasoned. Simple pleasure. My thanks to the handsome restaurant manager on duty on the 21 September and the staff attending to the area opposite the fried carrot cake station. Their friendly service was prompt and was one of the best experiences at the hotel. Unfortunately the list of names I meant to thank was misplaced. But my sincere thanks to the team.

"joejoe696969Kuala Selangor, Malaysia",Poor Hygiene and value!,"Did not stay at the hotel, only had the seafood weekend buffet, which was advertised so nicely, but was horrible.Witnessed twice on the same occasion during dinner buffet that a waiter sneezed openly, without covering his mouth. That spoil appetite immediately. How can a upmarket hotel not teach the staff about basic personal hygiene?Food range is also limited. Sashimi is thin slices only.Sushi is very limited and not authentic at all.Dont think that the sashimi and oysters are very fresh, wife had a bit of food poisoning symptoms after consuming the buffet.Range of sashimi only 3 types, surely you can afford to have at least 5 different types of sashimi, and to include common items like tako (boiled octopus) and ika (raw squid). Cooked octopus was advertised on their online poster, but was not even seen on the buffet. The online shows beautiful cooked lobsters as a visual on the poster, but there was not cooked lobster available on the buffet. The only cooked lobster and cooked Alaskan crab was labelled ""for display only"".Definitely misleading marketing!!! Not to mention their fine print: ‚ÄúAs we serve the freshest produce, this is an indicative menu and content is subject to change without notice‚Äù They dont even replace missing items, just quietly missing in action, like the 3 sashimi items!Grilled satay was still undercooked, still can taste bit of raw muscle meat inside the satay. Or was the satay supposed to be sashimi?For a RM 150 buffet, there are no drinks included in the package! Even a buffet at Seoul Garden KSL have drinks inside. How much can drinks cost? The restaurant scrimps and cuts corners from what is labelled as a high end buffet.Don't go to the weekend seafood looking for crabs, as you will only find crap!Show less",1.0,Reviewed 17 July 2019 ,Makan Kitchen at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

A large steamer with just a steamed seabass inside the Chinese food counters, Sashimi and oysters were not very fresh, all did not feel like they were cool. Felt more like room temperature. Oysters had the weird squishy, mashed texture. Informed the lady waiter about it. Not sure if she understood me, she just cleared my plate, and did not hear from her after that.Roasted lamb rack was only room temperature despite it was under the heating lamps. Indian tandoori chicken and other Indian delights were also lukewarm.Stir fried seafood was also not fresh - the crayfish had a strong freezer smell which could not even be covered by the black pepper sauce. This could be one of the main reasons why the restaurant was not full on the day I was there.Couch seats are also badly maintained. You can feel the whole couch move when guests are other table sits down.Does not feel value for money eating the dinner buffet.Totally disappointing for a buffet at a high end chain.

I must say this is like the concepts of straight kitchens from Singapore hyatt where there are different kitchens like Chinese, Malay, Indian etc. Very easy to locate food based on the race. Yet it has a good seafood spread like aquamarine where oyster, sashimi and snow crab are served. Best of all they already pre-cut the shell so that it is easy for u to pull put the snow crab flesh. The desserts are way as good as aquamarine where Panna cotta is super delightful and good standard entremet cakes are served. Not only local cuisine are served, Japanese (sushi and sashimi) and Korean (spicy rice cake and bulggogi beef) are served. I must say though the food is halal, it is very authentic taste!

This time i promised the manager i would do it.Food - Cannot miss out the cold section! I always go for the Oysters, prawns and snow crab legs. What makes me keep coming back is the oysters. It is huge, creamy and as fresh as it can get. Prawns are sweet and firm. Basically i get full from eating these 2. The selection is quite ok (chinese, salad, a bit of japanese, indonesian, indian, pasta and dessert). You cannot miss out the most popular Durian cake. Whenever it is out, a quarter will be gone. It is like eating the real durian with coconut milk. Yum! The dessert section is quite big, it is about 30% of the whole buffet. Kids go crazy! The hot section has room to be improve though. I would even go once a month if the hot dishes are as good (and 2hrs of crossing the causeway wont sway my determination to eat there).Service crew - I don't know how the manager do such a good job training the staff. Everyone is very helpful and friendly. They are always smiling and they will ask you politely if they can clear your plates (and they do it diligently). They treat every diner as their friend.

As such we have found tomato sauce, crumbs and even curry on these a few times. I understand that the waiters wipe these mats down but what happens to whatever liquid that seeps in between the groves of these mats?

"Matthew NPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Good Spread for Breakfast,"I read on the tripadvisor reviews that the Makan Kitchen@Doubletree ranks no 4 of all the 692 restaurants reviewed before I came to the hotel. I had checked in there recently for my cousin's wedding and would do my normal research of the place before I came here.Having worked as a hotelier many years ago I had the opportunity to have my duty meals at the coffee house buffet from time to time. Needless to say, many ex-hoteliers are not usually keen on hotel buffet, especially the breakfast. So usually ex-hoteliers such as myself will tend to avoid the local hotel buffet breakfast and walk out to the local to sample street food.But having read the reviews of this restaurant I was more than eager to give it a go.The service is needless to say very good. I had reviewed the hotel as a whole and the entire staff at the hotel including the staff at the Makan Kitchen were quite professional and friendly.The spread was impressive and quite well layed out. They had a dimsum section with all the authentic steamers to give it that authentic dimsum feel. The western spread however was a little limited. They had the usual turkey ham and hotel buffet sausages.I must say though, the scrambled eggs at the buffet was perfectly done. It was soft, creamy and it had that fluffiness to its texture. Chef Gordon Ramsay once said in one of his videos that the first test they do to see if the chef was right for his kitchen was to see if they can cook scrambled eggs and Makan Kitchen team passed with flying colors.The local cuisine was a bit average for me though, as one who typically travels around for street food, I suppose my measurement can be a bit higher than average. The relatives who numbered in the dozens however complimented the nasi lemak. Although the roti-canai or roti prata was considered below average by consensus. (This is because the roti is not fluffy enough and in the end has the texture equivalent to the frozen ready ones)I would score the ambience as a 5 over 5. It was really well done, the furniture, the lay out,,,Since I was there with so many of my family members, I including their overall consensus of this place and say that the overall dining experience as very good.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 30 November 2016 ,Makan Kitchen at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

I would highly recommend paying for the buffet as then you can branch out and try different types of food in small portions.

Staffs were kind enough to have a short conversations with us and willingness to assist. Despite all that, the oysters were a let down. The first few batches of oysters are excellent. Plump, fresh and good accent of the ocean but after some time. The oysters seems dehydrated and tasteless. It's as if the oysters have been shucked earlier and being left exposed in the refrigerator. It could be a way to control the flow of having diners from taking more oysters but having seeing a whole big tub of oysters by the side makes no absolute sense. It would also be better if the chef/cook who's shucking the oysters would have a little more urgency to shuck the oysters instead of spending almost 45 seconds to shuck one oyster and clean it with lemon water which often left the oyster bowl empty.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 12 September 2016 ,Makan Kitchen at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

I didn't try the noodles or the soup as I was more interested in the cooked crabs which went well with the paella. Our family and guests enjoyed the dinner very much.

"lindalF1078EPJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Street Eats buffet big let down,"My group of friends decided to give the Street Eats buffet a try. It was a Thursday evening and the restaurant did not have a crowd which we liked as we thought that would give us more chance at the food.My friends quickly set out to scan the food selection which was divided into 3 sections-chinese, malay and indian. One by one, they returned to their seats with barely filled plates and a look of disappointment on their faces. I finally understood what they felt after taking a walk around the restaurant myself.The menu selection was...miserable. I could not find any of the iconic street fare represented in the buffet presentation. There was no laksa, satay, ayam percik - nothing. What there was were poorly executed and a pathetic excuse for local food. Even my neighbourhood hawker stall served chicken shreds and fresh prawns in their noodle soup. Here at a Hilton property, my choice of ingredients for my noodle soup was restricted to fishball, fish cake and processed crabsticks.As I wandered around, a restaurant employee approached me. He was friendly and was nice enough to suggest that I start my meal with a double boiled lotus root soup from the chinese section. The idea brightened my mood and when he offered to have the soup served to my table, I began to grow hopeful....alas, the bowl presented to me was a watercress soup. It was good-don't get me wrong. But I was bemused that the staff could not get their food knowledge right.I took pinches of as many dishes as possible just to make sure my review would be a fair account. Cold food, sorely lacking in variety, horrible pistachio and banana flavoured ice cream - DISAPPOINTING.If you are a traveller and want to experience local street food, go visit the street hawkers for the real deal.

There was a good mix of Indian, Chinese, local, Malay and desserts as well, that include ice-cream. I love the noodle section especially which featured an all-authentic Johor Laksa and they also have a good salad bar. The only thing is the price is RM80 per person, which if even more expensive than the dinner or lunch buffet. Perhaps the reason is the good spread, however, how much could we eat? Especially ladies - so some may find it a waste. Another thing is the seating which is rather inflexible for big groups. There was a group of 15 of us and was meant to be a reunion but we were all split into three tables. So much for reunion. Once the crowd thinned, however, we moved our tables and joined it together. No staff came to help. We had to do it ourselves. And while we sat on till almost the close of the high tea at about 5 pm, nobody actually approached us for service. Yes, I know it is all self service but we rather felt neglected. Could do better at the coffee house. I must compliment the staff at the hotel entrance though. They were great!

"abo047Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Brand new hotel - management needs to listen to its staff!,"A spanking new hotel in a very convenient downtown location. However, my experience at the Makan restaurant was very disappointing. They were short staffed on a weekend - when many leisure weekenders from Singapore stay over.In addition, when I ordered the Malaysian breakfast, I was served 2 soft boiled eggs which were placed on two spoons on a plate replete with potatoes, sausages, mushrooms and toasts. The accompaniments were definitely not Malaysian at all! No soya sauce for the soft boiled eggs. I had to ask for a bowl to break my eggs in together with the soy sauce!At dinner I ordered nasi lemak. The chicken rendang provided was one small piece laid by the rice and other condiments. When I pointed out the meager portion of chicken provided, the waitress went back to the kitchen to only add in another small piece of chicken to the dish. The local kopitiams serve much bigger pieces of chicken rendang with their nasi lemak - and at a much lower cost, to boot!When I expressed my unhappiness about my dining experience to the supervisor, it was interesting and eye-opening to hear that he agreed with my complaints. He said that this has been pointed out at their regular staff meeting but to no avail. He told me to write in to the management as they do not take the views and suggestions of their staff seriously!!!That is a very sad state of affairs in this organization.I hope someone fromn the management reads this and begin to take note of the things that need attention to keep the guests coming back. Right now, I'm not so inclined to recommend this hotel until they clean up their act!Show less",3.0,Reviewed 19 August 2014 ,Makan Kitchen at DoubleTree by Hilton Johor Bahru

"DaveThompson16Ampang, Malaysia","Novel concept, tasty seafood ","A novel concept, for me at least. At Fatfish you make a number of choices to customize your own meal. For example, you begin with fish or seafood. We chose fish. There are four kinds of fish - we chose barramundi. There are 3-4 broths - we chose Szechuan. There are 3 levels of spice - we chose medium (we love spicy food but medium was plenty hot enough). For add-one, we chose bean sprouts, Chinese cabbage, egg noodles and prawns. Everything goes into the broth and it‚Äôs served, bubbling away. Fair to say none of this is obvious for the newbie, but luckily the staff are very welcoming and helpful, and they walk you through the ordering process and check back with you throughout the meal. The result is a very tasty meal, as long as you‚Äôre ok with this style of eating. Our fish disintegrated quite early, so finding the bits was a challenge. You have to dredge the broth to make sure you haven‚Äôt missed anything, but that‚Äôs part of the fun. Including a large beer and a water it came to RM169 for two of us, so you‚Äôre probably not going to visit too often. A good choice if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous.

We went for the low end of the chilli range of the schezuan soup, which was ‚Äúlip tingling‚Äù delicious. Hotpot was packed with a whole crab, mussels, clams, razor clams, prawns, scallops, squid, and mountains of vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, mushrooms). The mushrooms were amazing!

Of course i couldn't just stop there had to order the lobster!From my point of view the Lobster made the this review 4 stars! Must order, fresh and sweet!Ok now for the cons. When i was here they didnt have rice, sorry that is truly a no-no for me. (I just LOVE rice) Wished they pre-cracked the lobster and crab. So it would be easier for consumption :p Mostly if your here on a date or business. Wish they had more wipes unless you dont order the crab, shrimp, or lobster ;p But indeed its mainly why your here ;)Well as for the atmosphere. Its a nice decor has this little bot retro feel.

We wolved down oodles of handmade noodles and fried buns in Mala broth.One buddy‚Äôs face looked profoundly contented as he enjoyed a pot of freshly brewed quality floral tea.

This pot is awesome too with the varieties of fresh seafood which include sliced abalone, scallops, mussels, etc. But the Mala can numb your tastebud so please order at your own ""risk"".

damiar2022,TO IMPROVE MENU,I am sad because i am regular customer and i am shocked because there is no teppanyaki at live station & no more kids friendly food at dessert session .Last time there was a chocolate fountain that most hotel in KL have and now in Renaissance JB. After that there just a bowl with chocolate with fruits. But now no more and my kids keep asking. And new year eve there is no salmon? Can upper management work with chef on this?

hezrinsalmi,Need to improvise,"I am so called a regular walk-in customer with Cafe BLD and I am quite frustrated with the food quality. I went yesterday night with my family for buffet dinner. There were lots of guests and we are ok with that. The only thing is the food quality is not like ‚Äòthose days‚Äô whereby we can spent hours eating in the cafe. It was totally different yesterday when the foods are not really taste that good. I am not sure for other guests but for myself, I am very particular when comes to food. The spread looks quite alot but when I can only spend like 2-3 rounds only as the other foods doesn‚Äôt really looks tempting. We are paying RM88 per pax and its not really worth paying. I believed, there must be a changed on the chefs. It can be seen that the cafe is cutting cost as well. I hope the cafe can make more improvements on the foods quality otherwise they needs to revise back the price for all buffets.

ID196507,Undeserving of Top 5,"Stayed a week and had breakfast everyday. One morning I was showed to a table and hence placed my bag on the seat to go and get my food. When I return, I was told to move by some other guests and the same waitress that showed me the table, just stood there and watched. Didn't want to cause a scene, so I moved. However, this is really unacceptable service in a 5 or 4-star hotel. Service staff are pleasant enough but not very professional. Also, there was a hair in the cheese bowl at the omelette station, and when I pointed it out, instead of changing the bowl, the waitress simply took out the hair in front of me and left the bowl right there!!! Shocking. Overall the food is just acceptable.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 29 July 2019 ,Cafe BLD at Renaissance Johor Bahru Hotel

Busy chatting rather than doing their rounds to check on guest/buffet line. Food. Definitely not a 5 star standard base on quality and taste/flavour. The beef and lamb was tuft and hard. Pumpkin Soup blend. Satay peanut sauce-too sweet. Steam prawn-not fresh and the sauce for steam prawn is bad. Salad bar-quite good but the salad dressing is really bad. Roti nan was cold and hard. Dessert- really bad. Dessert spread is mostly cakes. 90% Overall I'm disappointed. Will never go back to BLD cafe. Show less,2.0,Reviewed 18 June 2019 ,Cafe BLD at Renaissance Johor Bahru Hotel

But things can be much better if they really put effort in it..I went there 3 or 4 months ago, that time food were incredibly good, it's like the best in JB. You never get bored eating. Compare with last weekend, foods are totally disappointing.1. Chicken satay is the most hardest chicken satay we ever had.2. The beef, chicken, duck are also hard. Squids as well.. They didn't control the cooking time well. I doubt those are chef cook. 3. For people who don't eat beef, especially Chinese, we really got not much selections. Because many of the dish are beef. Didn't see any lamb/mutton dish. 4. Curry, are just curry. Dhal - only curry and dhal. Chicken curry - only chicken and curry. Can put a little bit more ingredients make the dish looks more nicer and tastier. Hotel serve this kind of curry?? Even the mamak have a better look curry. Sorry to be frank. 5. Only 1 part they put bowls for customer, and it's many times out of bowls.6.fish soup - heavy artificial flavoured soup. That's all I can remember. Blame to the last visit in September, Food are too good. Because of that I signed the Club Marriott Card, this weekend when i go I expected like the last visit, but got a big disappointment. Mostly all food served hard, over cooked. Simple food can be delicious if you really control and cooking time well. Really doubt those are chef cook.

"fireblasterSingapore, Singapore",Very nice breakfast,"Decided to try out the breakfast buffet at Cafe Bld during a day trip to Johor Bahru. It was easy to reach Renaissance Hotel, around 10 minutes drive after clearing customs.We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of breakfast choices. What made this place unique was that there was a teppanyaki counter as well as a grill counter, which made this place stand out from most other hotel breakfast buffets where the spread was pretty standard. I could choose chicken, cuttlefish and several types of veggies to be prepared teppanyaki style. The grill had beef and chicken steaks as well as sausages. You choose what you want and both counters cooked the food for you on the spot. Of course there was the standard fare like fried noodles, hash browns, roti canai, breads and cheeses, porridge selection, egg station, dim sum, dessert, cakes and fruits, etc.The staff were warm, friendly and attentive. The restaurant was very cosy and relaxed. Although it was a Saturday morning, the crowd was relatively light possibly due to the hotel not being in the city centre, which made our meal experience very enjoyable without the maddening queues at the various food counters.Adult is RM55 and children around half that price, which is quite acceptable.

"TangWinstonSingapore, Singapore",Food is Good but Service is Better,"On 4 December, I brought my family to Cate BLD @ Renaissance in Permas Jaya, Johor, to celebrate my dear wife‚Äôs birthday and a relax outing for my daughter for having finished her University exam. This was our 4th visit since our last visit in May.We were glad that those staff who had served us during our last visit, still recognized us and warmly welcome us. Manager Parthy was doing his round to ensure diners were well served, straight away recognized us as we were led to our table. We chatted like old friends. Surprisingly we were ushered to the same table as our last visit. As we settled down, Dalfie and Eileen who were stationed near our table, greeted us with their warm smiles. As Eileen was serving us water, Dalfie asked if I would like my usual cappuccino. This is what I called Good Service, when staff even remembers their diner‚Äôs favorite drink which I would like it, to start and end my meals.When Patricia, caf√© supervisor who was not at the caf√© at that time, was informed of our presence, she came to greet us and started chatting with my wife. We felt so welcome despite our last visit was seven months ago. Our daughter was pleasantly surprised at the warm reception accorded to us.Below are our comments on the food review . . .1) Roast duck, their signature dish is superb. Is a must have2) Satay ‚Äì beef & lamb are great and chicken is good3) Teppanyaki selection needs improvement. Good to have more mushroom selection instead of only one type accompanied by 4 other vegetables. As for meat selection, it will be good to include scallop and prawn besides dry oyster, chicken and beef4) Mango pomelo is good but durian cake needs improvementMy wife was happy with the Chinese variety and rounded up her meal with ice cream, while my daughter prefers the Western spread and the chocolate fondue. I round-off my meal with the 5 selections of cheese that goes well with my aromatic cappuccino.Overall, we give 5 stars for service and ambience, 4 stars for food and value for money.

Ahmad Fadzadi Z,"Fantastic Food, Ambient Place","It is my first time here in Renaissance Hotel Johor Bahru. The food was in varieties, very tasty, the environment was very nice, and the hotel staff was very polite. I noticed that Laksa Johor as the local cuisine is not served in the menu, but I think it is alternate between Mee Rebus and Laksa Johor. Please include Laksa Johor as well in the menu, if it is not there.I observed the so-called 'rich' hotel guests' food both besides my table were not finished before they left the cafe. For me, it is very rude and very irritating, while the poor peoples outside there even do not have anything to eat. We should be grateful and thankful to God The Almighty who gave us the meal.I would suggest the Hotel management to issue penalty/fine/backcharges to the hotel guests who do not finished their meal based on the weight of their leftover food.

"cutedinoMelbourne, Australia","Great variety of food, good service","Was a little hesitant to try out the place as the hotel is a bit off the beaten track and as we drove in, I realised there were so many local eateries around the hotel so wondered how good could the food and choices be. And we were pleasantly surprised. As we entered the restaurant, the manager did inform us that due to water supply disruptions earlier in the day, there were ongoing issues with the airconditioning in the hotel. This was being rectified by another department, but boy did the service staff at the restaurant bear the brunt of it. Some of the patrons were so rude and unreasonable when the service staff(especially the manager and supervisor in their suits) were running around carrying huge fans, rearranging the wires etc so that everyone could enjoy the fans equally.The food, what can I say, there was a choice for everyone in the family. Kids enjoyed and loved the fresh seafood and sushi. Hubs and I enjoyed the grilled meats, satay and middle eastern food(dips and flatbreads, rice cooked with lamb, the grilled butterfish which hubby enjoyed a lot!). Live stations cooking noodles, teppanyaki, preparing the sushi and sashimi, frying the goreng pisang, the grilling stations outside, no wonder the restaurant was packed. The dessert section was a favourite with many, at least 8 choices of ice creams, shaved ice with so many choices of toppings, chocolate fountain, candy floss maker. The middle eastern baklavas were my favourite with a variety made with different nuts(pistachios, walnuts, almonds). Food was fresh and refilled very quickly. All mummies were gifted a box of two macarons at the end of the meal. Was bracing myself for 'bad service' as per some earlier reviews, There was a indeed very a very busy lady at the reception who handled both guests going in and out but she attended to us promptly without any issues and was friendly. The restaurant was full so the staff were kept very busy. Our area was serviced by two young staff, Ika(did things quickly and kept a smile on her face all the time even though things got very busy and warm) and another young man, both cleared our plates promptly and filled our cups of water whenever it required filling. When I asked for coffee and milk and the milk came served warm(yay!). Service was good even when it got busy.Aside from the airconditioning (which was a hotelwide issue), we had a lovely time and had eaten so much and yet no chance to try all the different food.

"A-Yank-in-OzPerth, Australia",Spoiled for choice,"I was here two years ago, and I'm pleased to see that they have taken my recommendations to include more Western selections. I'm here for a 9 night stay, and have had 1 breakfast and 1 dinner in Cafe BLD thus far. Breakfast: a wonderful variety of food & drink, both Asian and Western, to please every palate. Dinner: this time I skipped the extensive buffet and ordered a la carte. French onion soup was very tasty and a generous serving, but it was missing the cheese crouton that is described (at least on the room service menu) and is traditional with this dish. Marriott burger was huge, but the meat was too well done, so I had to eat the burger with knife and fork since it was hard to bite into with the bun and all. French fries were done to perfection. Service: I was warmly welcomed at breakfast, and had good service for coffee, clearing plates, etc. At dinner, however, the girl at reception was 'busy' on the phone and barely looked up at me, making no effort to get one of her colleagues to take me to a table. After waiting for nearly a minute, luckily another staff member saw my predicament and took me to a well-lit table where I could read whilst I ate. My waiter more than made up for the receptionist's negligence - he was solicitous and very professional. (Unfortunately I forgot his name, but I'll probably see him again and I'll include it in another review :) Room service: I had this the night I arrived, and it was fantastic. Wonderful mushroom soup, perfectly fried and abundant plate of prawns, and a huge Caesar salad.

"Franck_RozaidaJohor Bahru, Malaysia","Buffet Diner at Renaissance, 2nd try","I visited this buffet dinner about a year ago, and gave a real good review.Mentioned some points for improvement, something on safety in the parking area and the poor coffee.I was happily surprised to get a personal reply from the F&B manager, who mentioned that things would be looked into.Visited this place again and to my dissappointment the safety concern was not looked into. It's a pity as it wouldn't take much effort to solve it.Food was good, selection also. Service was surprisingly good, better than last time even. At the end of the dinner I found out why: management instructed the waiters to pass a ""DO TELL"" card. Positive about this is that management has understood the power of social media. Negative is that the waiters were really pushing this and to preferable mention their name in a positive way. It became a bit annoying and suddenly makes the service less sincere than I thought it was. Anyway if you're hungry for decent food, superficially good service, and don't mind your head getting knocked on the aircon duct while entering the lift area (tall people only ;) ) then go ahead.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 21 December 2015 ,Cafe BLD at Renaissance Johor Bahru Hotel

"MK6164Singapore, Singapore",Not as good as what others said,"Maybe it's because I have been reading so many good reviews about this Cafe BLD, which is why I was having quite high expectation of this so-called ""Best Buffet in Johor"" in a 5-star hotel.We were there during the Deepavali period. When we requested for a baby chair, I was shocked to learn that they have ran out of baby chair! And honestly, I don't really see lots of kids around. Definitely less than 10. And they tell me they do not have baby chair? And the 2nd shock I got is, when I thought there should be some stuff which I can feed my 18mth old baby, I was surprise that they do not have porridge. They do not even have noodle soup, or not even bread, or creamy soup which I can feed my daughter.Maybe I was pampered by buffet restaurants in Singapore, whereby most of them, or I would say ALL of them, will sure to have some things that are suitable for solid eating babies. Not to mention having sufficient amount of baby chairs.Besides that, the food range that night was not a lot as well. The fresh oyster taste blend and ""defrosted"". There is pasta station, cooked food station with about 4-5 dishes (mostly indian food as it was deepavali), kebab, tempura basket with a few pathetic pieces of fried vegetables. The only good thing I remember eating was the cooked-on-the-spot roti canai. That's all.And the all-praises dessert station was really nothing to sing about. Their ice cream is normal Wall's ice cream standard. The cakes are okay, but I was shocked to learn that a piece of cake that was labelled as ""Pistachio Cake"", turn out to be durian cake! What if there are some people who doesn't eat durian took that? And that is not all. The New-York cheesecake was labelled as some chocolate cakes.

"NeomarshalLondon, United Kingdom","Poor service by foreign staff, a limited menu and small portions","Spice Grill has really gone down the drain since the lockdown with poor service by foreign staff, a limited menu and small portions. Most of the reviews here are over a year ago so allow me to provide a more recent update for 2021.We went as a family with 3 kids. When we arrived, the restaurant looked deserted as we were the ONLY table on a Saturday night. Later one more customer walked in and that was it.Most of their waiting staff are foreigners from India or Bangladesh who are not familiar with local customs. The menu was very limited and you can see from the photo that its just a few sheets of old laminated paper.When the food arrived, our hearts sank as the portions were so small. We had to order extras due to the small portions and I believe this is their tactic to increase revenue! The food were not even nice to eat except for their tandoori lamb but it was only 2 small pieces of lamb!!!In conclusion, you are better off to AVOID Spice Grill and go down the street to Les Bouchons or Tribus at Menara Teega!!!Show less",1.0,Reviewed 9 October 2021 ,Spice Grill

Decor is modern and music is soothing to hear. Fragrance inside the restaurant is quite pleasant and easy. Price pointThis is the part made my whole rate given as 2 star. I feel this restaurant‚Äôs entrepreneur have cascaded too much of their operating cost on the food itself. Which supposed to be, however certain food pricing is exorbitant. We are 5 kids and 4 adults and we spent a total of RM900+ which is a pricing bracket for upper scale restaurant in JB - KL areas. What disappoint the most is basic element of Indian food is rice and they charge $8.00- $9.00++ per small bowl of of plain Basmati Rice. As it is, each of their main dishes costs around 200++ each. Taste wise, if you love South Indian palate, these food are a complete letdown. However if you are a North Indian-fusion lover then maybe this restaurant is a good fit. I personally thinks the taste and food serves the best for Non Indian foreigners and tourists in JB/SPORE.

The live band playing just outside kinda spoilt the ambiance which I think on any other day except New Years Eve, would have been quieter.

We had originally ordered a squid dish but they served us the fish one instead. We brought it to the attention of the service staff and they were sincerely apologetic for the mix-up. We didn't pursue it and since we already started on the dish, we stuck with the fish instead (it tasted really good anyway). Unexpected to us, they provided us with a complimentary cheesecake and scoop of ice cream (for our kid) as part of their service recovery. I think this is really wonderful as it speaks volumes of their restaurant's culture. Moreover, one of the service staff overheard us calling our son's name, and he proceeded to address my son accordingly whenever he came to service. I feel that this is a heartwarming gesture.

I ordered the garlic and butter naan with the lamb spicy curd masala which was recommended by the staff who served us. My daughter had the Australian Wagyu tenderloin. The Indian option was really good. The lamb masala was so flavourful and tender but really spicy so just a warning to folks who can‚Äôt take spicy food. I loved it though. The naan were also good. My daughter thought the butter naan was better than the garlic naan. The steak was so-so to me.

"semu2018Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Where is the chef hiding?,"On the 30th Dec our family of 4 adults and 3 children along with a guest from KL came to the restaurant for a year-end meal together. Two of the children have difficult food allergies - one child cannot eat wheat and the other egg. I had contacted the restaurant beforehand telling them about this. However, on our arrival we were told that they only had fish and chips for the children with the allergies. The child with the wheat allergy does not like fish so we asked if the kitchen could cook a portion of egg and rice for him (a very normal Asian food). The answer was a flat no, cannot!! We had brought with us a packet of gluten-free pasta (for cases such as this) and asked if the kitchen could cook the pasta. Normally, in fact always restaurants will oblige as they can see and empathise with the problem. But NOT Spice Grill! Again the answer was NO. We then asked if we could speak directly with the chef but apparently he had just left the premises?? The waiter said he would try to call the chef which he did, the end result of which was still a flat refusal to even cook the pasta for us. This to us was the limit and we voted with our feet and left the restaurant to a more friendly and understanding one. My advise to anyone with food allergies is to stay well away from this restaurant!!! Selma OksanenShow less",1.0,Reviewed 11 January 2018 ,Spice Grill

"MinxminxminGuangzhou, China","Fabulous food, gorgeous restaurant, disappointing service ","Having read so much about this restaurant and how great the Indian food was on trip advisor, we decided to give this a try. The Indian food was awesome - probably the best Indian food I ever ate. This gastronomic experience enriched my thoughts about Indian food once again. You can consider trying their mango curry. The blend of fruits and spices is flawless. Although the restaurant is for fine dining, they entertain customers who walked in with flip flops and shorts so no worries on dress code. However bringing young kids may be an issue since the restaurant is rather quiet. The customer service is poor in comparison to the environment. Firstly the waitress got my order wrong. I asked for 1 serving of plain naan. They gave 2 servings and when corrected, did not even apologize for their error. Secondly I ordered a 100gof grilled calamari (RM 20). What came was 2 pieces of uncut calamari served like steak...it didn't look like 100g but given the nonchalant service given during the plain naan mistake, I did not feel like asking them about this 2 big pieces of calamari. When the bill came, they charged us for 300g (RM60). After asking the waiter, he said they only sells a minimum of 300g per serving. But it's not stated on the menu anywhere and the waitress who took our order did not highlight this minimum order requirements. Given we are on vacation I decided to just pay up but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth despite the great gastronomic experience.

The service staff appears disinterested in serving as we stood at the door for several minutes without anyone bothering to entertain us. Finally, there was a promise of 15% Discount that was retracted after the meal because the email that was sent has 'bounced'.

The prawns were delicious, marinated with various spices. We also tried the highly recommended main course of grilled cod. It was tasty but the chef's special sauce was a tad too sweet for our liking. This dish was the most pricey item on the menu.Service was fine though staff was a bit slow with the bill.

Their Indian food is very good, in fact one of the best I had tried around Johor Bahru. They are flavorful enough, have a wide variety and cooked so well it leaves you wanting to go back for more. The Western menu though, was more limited and i find them although ok tasting but do not give off the wow factor or leaves you craving for more especilly the seafood. The seafood are not that fresh.

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Lovely!,"We visited 4 times in the past month, for lunch and dinner. There are many detailed and accurate reviews of this restaurant posted here on Tripadvisor, so I shan't go into details. Whether it's Indian, Western or fusion food (or not), indoor vs outdoor seating...it's all been covered. First up, 3 of our visits were with large groups, and all with kids. Also, we have only had Indian food here, so that's what I'll be writing about. The Indian menu is extensive and mainly of North Indian variety, although there is a tantalizing array of hard to cook and unusual South Indian dishes available as well. We found the food on all occasions to be delicious, especially the starters (the Prawn and Fish 65 were divine whilst the Murgh Sahajani was excellent). The mains are good too, although the vegetarian dishes can all taste somewhat similar-we had the Nadan Gobi Masala, Dal Tadka, Kumbh Mutter and Malai Kofta (a tad sweet). I found the egg omelette curry to be surprisingly good, and was impressed with the creamy and gently spiced Fish Coconut Curry. The Prawn Thengai Curry and the Nadan Fish Curry were good as well. All the curries tasted home-cooked, quite a feat! We had all sorts of bread and naan, white rice and pulao, to mop up our curries with. The Roomali roti was a firm favourite, the naans (plain/butter/garlic) coming up a close second. There is a good selection of alcoholic drinks available, and we normally let the waiters choose some white wine for us. Dessert is usually gulab jamun paired with vanilla ice cream. There is nothing vanilla about the combo though, it's very good. Service? Waiters are friendly and genuinely helpful although easily bewildered by customer demands. The Manager (Vikas), is a nice chap and so are most of the crew (Rohit and Munesh). Prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the location, decor, food and service. It's certainly a good place for special occasions, and has an interior designed to suit that intent. I would not want to wander into Spice Grill in my Bermudas. The Olive Restaurant located nearby has a more casual and cheerful vibe to it, especially when the outdoor bar comes to life at night. Our fourth visit was last night, to celebrate my Mum's birthday. The staff came to our table and did a dance and clap routine as a Happy Birthday song was played. Very nice! Finally, the location of the restaurant is such that parking directly in front is not possible. There is a car park in the basement with lifts leading up to a lobby that is a short walking distance from the restaurant. It's quite a walk from the open air car parks, so do consider the basement option for the elderly and wheelchair bound. Show less",5.0,Reviewed 2 May 2015 ,Spice Grill

"DANWENSouthampton, United Kingdom",Disappoinyed,"Had heard good things from a friend about Spice Grill and had read the reviews here so took my wife there tonight to see for ourselves.Certainly the location and the decor make an impression as you enter. There is a choice between air conditioned opulence inside or limited outside seating on the terrace with the harbour lights twinkling and a breeze. The tableware, linen, runner, and cutlery hint at some style and class, although let down by a simple paper napkin.The waiting staff were welcoming, polite and were keen to show us to a table but lacked a little patience when we were undecided to begin with over in or out.There are two menus. The Indian influenced one and the 'Fusion'. I did not pay much attention to the later as I had come out for spicey Indian style cuisine.The menu takes a while to thumb through as it is extensive and set out in a confusing manner, with similar dishes under different headings. To the new visitor, unfamiliar with what Spice Grill has to offer, this menu may seem daunting. My wife wanted a mixed vegetable curry. Something with maybe cauliflower, potato, onions etc, although there were many vegetable options none were familiar. I was after something interesting in the chicken or mutton range. We were struggling a little and needed help to find appropriate dishes for both our taste and appetite. I was hoping get some useful guidance from our waiter, as other reviews had praised the level of service in this regard.When the waiter arrived to take our order he was not as useful as I had hoped and communication was unclear. Not his fault but my attempts to get him to recommend dishes from the extensive menu based on our desires were frustrated.We settled on some papadams and a chicken dish appetiser followed by a mutton curry, some special rice, a mixed vegetable curry. The papadums were good, although were not accompanied by the usual anticipated range of chutneys. Only a single minty spicy condiment was presented. The chicken starter appeared to be some marinated pieces of chicken that had then been fried. Tasty and simple.When the main course arrived, the food was presented in small saucepans. The mutton curry looked and tasted OK, the vegetable Kurma was not as expected, having the un- appetising appearance of an oily green mash of unidentifiable vegetables. The Special SG rice was in/surprising; it was a bowl of white rice garnished with some cashew nuts.My wife was unable to eat the vegetable mash. I tried it but found both the flavours and textures to be bland and unsatisfying. Maybe in our unguided ignorance we had ordered a curry made with an unfamiliar vegetable that had been rendered down in the cooking process.Throughout the meal the waiters were attentive, although there main concern seemed to be whether we needed another drink; we were not asked if we were enjoying the food, whether all was OK or if we required anything else.In summary, an over complicated menu not supported by knowledgable and articulate waiters who can describe the menu to customers unfamiliar with the names given to the meals. In our case this resulted in us not choosing well and spoiling the experience we had. Value for money is difficult to assess as the food choices may be at fault rather than the food itself. Would we return?.........Probably won't rush back, there are other places nearby where we have also eaten where the food is simpler, more satisfying and the staff understand the needs of customers better and will go out of there way to ensure you enjoy your meal.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 14 April 2015 ,Spice Grill

Presented us with the menu straight away and prepared our drinks immediately and told us he would be back for our food orders. Great service informing us as that means not leaving us wondering ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù. He suggested a number of dishes to us which made the entire food ordering personal (my preference). I took his recommendation of the vongole and boy, I‚Äôm Glad I did. The setting within the restaurant was cozy and with that Italian music playing on the background, it made the whole experience pretty romantic though I was there with my family. Nice wooden tables and chairs and these were the small details that made a dining experience unique. Next can our food, delicious! I even had the opportunity to see them made our pizza. Oh yes, did I mentioned that they used a wood oven to bake their pizzas. The vongole was quite out of this world, extremely delicious. In fact, every one of the dishes that we had was really good. I just hope that they can maintain the food quality and standard. Not going to bore you down with the description of the food served here (it‚Äôs not possible, you just have to go try them out).Service throughout the meal was top-notched, never once we felt neglected. And a good gesture, they gave me a piece of their heavenly tiramisu. It was literally a piece of heaven on earth. Why have I tasted heaven that now I will be back each time I have a craving for good old Italian food!Please, the owners of Coppola, do not change a thing if you are reading this.

"Teh_AisKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",...,"I am from KL and tried this place after checking out the reviews. I was not impressed in terms of food standard, service and value vs. reviews given. Now, food preference is a very subjective manner - however having dined in many Italian restaurants both fine and casual, I'd just rate the food on a scale of 3.5/5. Service could have been better in terms of serving time and staff standard. Value is definitely at the lowest end of the scale. I only have two explanations for my experience with Coppola:1. Might have been an unlucky day for me. Things may go wrong.2. Other reviewers may have not the opportunity to experience something better.However, I do have to refute their statement of best Tiramisu in JB. It actually deserves the best Tiramisu in Malaysia (Having finally hunted the best Tiramisu that is closest to Italia in this country)Show less",3.0,Reviewed 5 October 2018 ,Coppola Family Pizzeria & Wine Bar

"cecilacchanSingapore, Singapore",Tough To Rate Restaurants Right,"Thousands of foodies rate restaurants so how do we get it right? This Coppola Restaurant is an example. On review before visiting it looks pretty good and my friends said ""die die must try"". Review say food excellent. Service here and there. So how do I rate it? Objective is to get most who read what I wrote concur. So position in Trip Advisor 23 out of 1,099, pretty decent. So majority believe this is a pretty good Eyetalian restaurant. Boss is definitely very friendly. Didn't try everything of course. But even without trying the Tiramisu is a rave by others. Pizza? Woodfire is good enough to ensure a good pizza. We tried Carbonara and it is good but I believe that if you recommend good not many will read your thread. We need the ""WOW! factor. So am always looking for this. Sorry Carbonara no wow. What is ""wow"" here. The Beef Ball - pic below. Initialy like not enough salt but it grows on you, good quality beef. Excellent with the chilly dip. Big helping even though 2 pieces. Wouldn't call it meatball though-misnomer. Next pic Pork Kebab. Kebab is best with lamb meat but not available, only pirk and chicken. Kinda weird, must be a story behind this. Owner care to tell. The Pork kebab is good but not wow. Hard, had to cut to small pieces and chew. But the spices entered the pork admirably well so it is tasty and the veggies are great. This is a case of not best quality pork but then in Malaysia that is to be expected. Overall it is a good meal. Food price is fair if prime ingredient is used.

A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. They have an extensive pizza menu, but a limited pasta menu. It would be wonderful to see some gnocchi or ravioli on the menu! The tiramisu however was probably one of the best I've ever had! Melts in your mouth, and the sponge finger middle was soft and smothered in just the right amount of liquor. Definitely recommend this!I've also visited the restaurant for sunday brunch just for some eggs benedict. The Hollandaise sauce is delicious (could use a little bit more), and they gladly accommodated my request to change the bacon to prosciutto which definitely made a wonderful difference. The egg however was slightly over done (not just for my portion, but also for my 3 guests with me)! It missed that runny yolk that so many look forward to watching when they cut into poached eggs. A little less time on the stove and I'm sure it would be perfect. All in all a good dish!The alcohol on the menu is slightly pricey, but this can reflect most of the bars around johor.

"GazzaGlenIris_VicWashington DC, District of Columbia",Exorbitant price that was charged for corkage,"My wife and I, along with our many friends here at Horizon Hills, are regular customers at Coppola restaurant. Sorry to say that tonight is the first time I have walked out of Coppola with the feeling of being ‚Äòripped-off‚Äô. We decided to head down to Coppola for a quiet night by ourselves and enjoy a pizza. The pizza was good...no complaints at all. And that compliment comes from a person who makes his own pizza from scratch and has a very high standard when it comes to pizzas.The extreme disappointment comes from the exorbitant price that was charged for corkage. To be perfectly frank, RM30 for corkage was a complete shock. It was wife‚Äôs and my opinion, and the opinion of many of my friends here in Horizon Hills, that the corkage now charged is excessive and overpriced.From my perspective, it has changed my opinion about Coppola...so much so that I would rather spend 30 minutes making my own pizza and enjoying a glass or two of wine in my own house. I have no issue about paying a fair and reasonable price for corkage, but RM30 is simply overpriced and enough to consider other options. RM10-RM15 may be acceptable, however when Cathay restaurant, which is located at the Horizon Hills Golf and Country Club only charges RM5.00 per table, it makes Coppola restaurant well outside the range of being reasonably priced.

"Samuel CIskandar Puteri, Malaysia","Nice, but limited","Coppola is a very pleasant bar/ restaurant with a genuine Italian pizza oven.Even though the restaurant is somewhat separated by a dividing wall, the relatively small size of the place means that the atmosphere can be dictated by just one or two groups of customers. I have been in here when it has been overcrowded by a few families, dominated by some sports loving men and almost dead quiet. This does not detract from the fact that not only is the food tasty (although on the expensive side for Malaysia), it is also a nice place to have a drink and watch some sports.The menu seemed a little limited, with no sides and the pizzas all of the same type (thin crust base). There are pasta and salad options.The drinks are no more expensive, in fact possibly cheaper than elsewhere in Malaysia.I also thought that there was not enough seating available, nor the screens quite big enough to call this a proper sports bar, or enjoy the sports that are clearly a feature of the place.Perhaps it suffers from a captive audience, with a huge condo block directly opposite, and it does a roaring trade in take away pizzas.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 27 August 2014 ,Coppola Family Pizzeria & Wine Bar

I ordered cheese naan n the waiter said smtg but all i know it was nt available. Thn i asked for chapatti and she said all the breads will be ONLY AVAILABLE AFTER 6PM. And thn i was wondering wht else can i order? Other that briyani... and thn my friend asked for vegetarian set meal. And she said they don't serve it anymore and it is been removed frm the menu. Oh great ! Then we had no choice ordering the briyani. And then she said briyani is not a set n it comes only with rice. Thus, he had to order other side dishes to eat with the rice. WOW NOW WE HAVE TO CREATE OUR OWN BRIYANI we were forced to order briyani cause thats the only thing they serve now and the BRIYANI TASTED LIKE TOMATO RICE. I didn't taste any spices in there. It was blunt. Not spicy at all. I was a fan of their briyani but AIN'T NO MORE. I guess 7 SPICE SHOULD CHANGE THEIR NAME TO 7 nothing. When we wanted to pay, a customer came in n asked if chappati was available at the front counter n guess what? He said yes chappati is available. Kudos for being vague and indefinite.

A variety of food was ordered, several types of naan, chicken, fish and lamb dishes. Meats were succulent and the gravies/curries were well balanced, tasty but not overpowering. Basically, the food did not let us down. Just be advised that some dishes are rather spicy so if not familiar get the advice of staff. There was free flow lime juice but I also had mango lassi. Surprisingly, the mango lassi tasted more like a smoothie than a lassi. I prefer my lassi with more of a sourish tang, not as a sweet drink. Dessert, we had a stewed fruit (probably a fig or pear) with vanilla ice cream. The vanilla ice cream tasted like a commercially available ice cream, not like gelato or freshly made. I also had masala cha, which was not as I expected. Very thick tasting tea, with only a weak hint of masala. It was however not sweet which was good. There was about 20+ of us and I suppose because of the pre ordered food, they managed well. Though my only comment is that food trickled onto the table, rather than be served together. I think for Asian food, I personally prefer everything to be served together. If you go down the escalator outside the restaurant, there is the marina with pretty lights. There was also some live music. Seemed like a nice place to relax after dinner.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 9 April 2016 ,7 Spice Indian Cuisine

All of us were damn hungry and were quite scared of seeing the ""closed"" sign on the restaurant since it was very late (around 4pm). To our surprise, they welcomed us and had us seated in no time. Another surprise was the availability of food...We were actually prepared to get some food, whatever they had to offer to still our hunger and were not expecting the luxury of going through their long menu. But, almost everything we ordered was available...! We ordered a variety of food ranging from steamed rice to chicken dum biriyani along with some drinks. The food was pretty good, except the chicken biriyani as it was more of the malaysian style biriyani and did not smell/taste like a dum biriyani. Otherwise, the chicken side-orders were good and so were the vegetarian options.

The food is fresh, tasty and unmistakably South Indian, with some North Indian items. They have a lunch buffet but you can order ala carte too, and the variety is fantastic. Food however, leans on the very hot side, and not just spicy, as Indian food is wont to be. Indeed, you will find bits of cili padi liberally sprinkled into the dishes and gravies. Prices are reasonable, whilst the service is good all around.

My wife and I tasted Chicken Kurma, Butter Chicken, Kashmir nun, and some other Indian food in both restaurants and and all of them were crazy! I personally recommend Butter Chicken, because it has a unique mix of different spices and you can distinguish each one of them eating a spoon of the stew. Please remember that you are going to taste Indian food, so be prepared for Hot dishes.

"ThaiFarangComUdon Thani, Thailand",Tasty Food with Great Service,"I ordered take out from 7 Spices last night as it very close to Tune Hotels Danga Bay where I‚Äôm staying. It was a Friday night around 8:30PM and the place was very busy. Despite this, I was greeted by friendly staff that spoke perfect English and helped make ordering suggestions. I ordered palek paneer, aloo mutter, and garlic naan. As I sat waiting I noticed almost everyone in the place appeared Indian. While perhaps they are visitors, it seemed more likely the case that this restaurant is popular with Indians living in the area. The atmosphere seemed very nice despite it being very busy. I was also pleasantly surprised that my order came in what felt like no time at all. It was probably just under 10 minutes that I waited.Getting the order involved an interaction with a second staff member. He brought over the bags, opened them up to verify contents and then thanked me and told me to enjoy. It then occurred to me I didn‚Äôt have utensils, so I headed back inside to ask. A third staff member said sure no problem, how many sets. He then raced over to the back and returned quickly with a plastic spoon and fork. I was thanked this time by a women at the counter on the way out. That‚Äôs 4 friendly interactions with staff during my short trip to get takeaway.Finally, the food was very delicious. The palek paneer was unique. It was without chunks of cheese as the dish is sometimes prepared. It was rather well mixed and creamy and was a bit on the sugary side creating its own unique favor. I am not sure I‚Äôll order that again next trip but did enjoy it. The food that blew me away was the aloo mutter. This was one of the best I‚Äôve tasted anywhere. Those not used to spicy food might find it very spicy. I have a super high spice tolerance so it came off mild to me, but had some kick that gave it an amazing flavor. The naan was very good, soft / easy to tear and tasted awesome with these dishes. I‚Äôll be back here again tonight with plan to order aloo mutter again and will try another spicy dish from the menu.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 23 May 2014 ,7 Spice Indian Cuisine

RavikantKuala Lumpur,Decent North Indian type food at reasonable prices,"I had recently an opportunity to take some friends out for lunch to the 7 Spice restaurant. This was my first visit to the restaurant as I was visting Johor Bahru on some business. The place is situated in the Danga Bay area with lots of shop lots around. There is no exclusive or separate parking space for those visiting the restaurant; we however did not find any difficulty in finding a place to park in the common parking lots a short distance away from the restaurant. The space inside the restaurant is large - having no particular or distinctive ambiance inside. Interestingly, the menu does not serve Naan or any Indian bread during lunch times. These are only available during the evenings. However, one could order the tandoori/ meat/ vegetable dishes. My friends ordered Chicken Biriyani, the portions of which were adequate. Biriyani was served with Raita (small sized onion slices soaked in curd). The dishes were served almost immediately, without any waiting. A rectangular banana leaf is placed in front of you to place your food items on to it instead of ceramic plates.The quality of the Basmati rice used and the taste of the biriyani could have been little better - my friends however liked it. Few aspects about the Biriyani. In the Indian traditional cooking, chicken or vegetable biriyani is prepared by cooking the rice and meat pieces together with the aromatic Indian spices. That way the flavor is blended into both the rice and the meat pieces. I suspect that here it is done otherwise. I saw the waiter taking chicken pieces separately and then add the cooked biriyani rice on top of the pieces. Also the biriyani is served here in open containers. Traditionally, it is supposed to be served in small containers which are sealed/ covered at the top. One has to just remove the cover before having the biriyani. That way the flavor is retained in a fresh state until the food is consumed. Also, another important ingredient is the selection of the right type of Basmati rice. Usually, one selects the long grained Basmati rice. This basmati rice is so aromatic that the aroma would fill the whole house even when it is being cooked. This feeling or flavor was absent here. Our bill was also not too large an amount as the rates too are pretty reasonable here. Interestingly, no service charge or taxes are levied on the food items. They are all nett priced. Finally, the restaurant is ok, if one is in a bit of hurry and is hard pressed for time specially during the afternoons.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 23 November 2013 ,7 Spice Indian Cuisine

We were impressed by the ambience and the layout. Orders were taken fast by a friendly foreign worker. After that, everything was just negative.1) service was so slow. There were about 8 + staff. Some at the food counters. Some standing around and some at the cashier. None of them followed up after the orders were taken. We had to call them and request for the banana leaves and rice and vege to be served. Then too, the service was so slow that I think we could have drove into Spore and returned to Singapore! Most of the staff were idling and least enthusiastic about anything.2) horrible food - I do not get it. Is this really an Indian restaurant? Fish curry was sweet, side dishes were sweet, sambal fish was sweet and overloaded with belachan and smelly and worse was the so called signature grilled cheese giant prawns which tasted as tho it was cooker with just sugar and the disgusting sweet mutton in the dum mutton briyani. When we enquired the waiter just stared at us blankly n said she does not know. And we requested to speak to the manager , he never came. Sambar tasted horrible too.3) rice was practically half steamed.4) only edible food was the pepper crab. Fresh and spicy.rm120 for crab. Rm100 for the disgusting sweet cheese giant prawns (x5 pieces) +++ = rm380. Not worth a single cent dining in this restaurant.

One of the most disappointing aspects was the 'freshly squeezed orange juice'--- it seemed like the person making the juice had forgotten to add orange juice to the water.

"PattufromSGSingapore, Singapore",Worth a visit! ,"The reviews all over the internet speaks of 30min waiting time to have Kam Long Fish Head curry -extremely famous at Johor Bahru. That wait time is accurate. However that's about it. You need not extrapolate further. I checked queues at 10am, 12am and 2pm; and in all those slots the queue length was around 20-30mins not more, not less. Food, off course, finishes most days by 3pm. For family (or group) of four, I would recommend taking the large fish tail serving as it has enough meat. The fish head servings don't have much meat. The curry pot though contains a bed of beans, ladyfingers and cabbage which ensures a thick layer of vegetables. Honestly the curry (with vegetables) stand-alone would make a great meal with rice. Hence, this is a must visit place and I recommended to visit around 11am for an early lunch with delicious and memorable fish head curry broth. Total cost for meal for four 70MYR = 18SGD = 14USD including Chinese tea and rice for four!

It was only 11am and a queue had already formed outside the shop. However, the queue moved quite fast and we were seated in less than half an hour. Perhaps it was still early.The service was prompt and we were served our curry very quickly after we ordered. Make sure you order an extra helping of vegetables and the popular bean curd/tau Kee. We ordered a medium sized fish head curry. It was not extremely fantastic. Firstly, we thought the curry was a bit thin. Secondly, the medium fish head which cost RM$33(fish head only) was only half a head. Not much meat. The whole clay pot of curry was enough for 5 of us. If you want meat, order the fish tail. That comes with meat on two sides of the tail end of fish. That cost a few ringgit more, but I think it would be more worth it. (Haha, so much for curry fish head...curry fish tail?)

Graceybo0Singapore,Worth the wait ,"This place needs no introduction.. it has made a name for itself through out the years for being the best curry fish head in JB. Kam Long has managed to sustain it's popularity with only one dish and one dish alone - fish head curry. This may not be the place for one who seeks variety but then again, who needs that when you have such a rich assortment of flavors in 1 sizzling pot?The queueing time is approx 1 hour on most days.. getting a seat in under 45 mins should be considered a blessing. Service was prompt and polite despite their never ending crowd of starving diners. Their curry was aromatic and flavorful.. a tad bit on the creamy side, just the way I like it. It was not too spicy, making it a suitable dish for children or for those who don't like spicy foods.The fish was fresh and cooked upon ordering to ensure quality. Veggies were generous though I wish they would give more tau kee (bean curd skin) to soak up all that delicious gravy. It's one of the best curry fish head I've had in a long time and for about 21RM per head. It's definitely worth the price and the wait. Show less",5.0,Reviewed 1 August 2016 ,Kam Long Curry Fish Head

YvonneWoiMalaysia,One of the BEST Fish Head Curries in JB,"The eatary caught my attention because there's forever a beeline of patrons waiting outside the shop. I have always been curious about this shop but never managed to stop and check out this place until my friend who has frequented it for the past 12 years raves about it. For a shop that sells and serves ONLY ONE dish and yet has faithful patrons willing to wait under the hot sun for the food, it's got to be good. So I decided to check it out this week. Tucked in the hole-in-a-wall pre-war shop in downtown JB, Kam Long has been in business for 30 years. This is one of those unpretentious old school kopitiam (coffee shop) style eataries with minimal or no deco. If you can't locate the shop, just follow your nose.The servings came in individual, small, medium or large. Since there were only two of us, we ordered the small pot. The service is pretty fast as the fish head curry was served in less than 10 minutes, in a claypot. The food is freshly prepared as the gravy was still boiling and pipping hot with smoke but when it was served, and the serving size is generous even for two people.They say the head is the most flavourful part of a fish, I couldn't agree more, especially in this dish. The spices in the curry enhance the natural flavour of the head without overpowering it. Together with tofu skin, ladies finger, long beans and cabbage, it's a complete meal on its own. But the part that I enjoy the most is when the flesh flakes off the bone and melts in your mouth... absolutely delicious! Besides being a little stuffy and crowded and had to wait for 10 minutes before we were being seated, I had nothing to complain about this place. For one not-so-small claypot of scrumptious fish head curry, two plates of rice plus two drinks, the bill came to RM25, what a STEAL! Will definitely come back. Tips:1. It's extremely difficult to get a parking around the shop area. The best way is to park your car (if you are driving) at City Square or JBCC Komtar and walk over, it's only two blocks away. 2. To avoid lunch time crowd, go before 11:30 am. There will still be a beeline but it's much shorter wait time compared to later. The curry is pretty much sold out by 2:30 pm3. If you don't want to share table eating fish curry with strangers (very scene in Asia, the food is so good, you don't mind sharing tables), go there in a group of 3-4 which is just enough to fit in a table. But that also means you have to wait longer though.4. Don't bother to bring young children, I am not even sure if they have high chair. If you want to eat in peace without sweating buckets, tapau (take away) and enjoy the curry at the comfort of your home.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 16 January 2015 ,Kam Long Curry Fish Head

The curry they serve is a blend of your traditional curry (like chicken curry) and laksa, so don't expect the very thick type of sauce. Spicy level is moderate (FYI, I am someone that can take spicy food)They serve only fish head which I guess why the quality still maintains so well. Please expect to wait at least 20 mins as there is a constant queue that never ends (I have not seen any instant where there is no queue).

"jeffchia88Singapore, Singapore",Excellent Buka Puasa Feast,"Well it is Ramadan again. The fasting period for all Muslims.My partner and I had a feast here last year and we wanted to check out the food this year around. Well we were to met Shah whom we met last year, his service standards are impeccable. He learned about my problem with sitting and moving out of the table if the chair was too heavy and arranged for us for a table with lighter chairs.There is a new F&B manager -Murthi and he assured me of the quality of the food. He rightly did, as the food is excellent this year. He had recommended the Venison Rendang. The dish is really delicious, The meat is tender and was stewed with the Rendang Spices. Western Gourmets, please take note that the meat should not be crispy. :-) The ambience was good , a Malay group was singing traditional Malay songs to entertain the guest.The soup is very tasty with different parts of the lamb. My partner who does not touch lamb just loved the soup, Haha I daren't tell her it was lamb soup and the meat is lamb.Another lovely dish they had is the Shrimps fired with the heart of a coconut palm. The prawns were fresh and crispy complemented with the crunchy sliced heart of the coconut palm.If you are a Durian Fan try out the Tempura Durian at the Goreng Goreng stand. Really yummy. There were other great durian desserts like Durian pudding, I added the durian paste meant for the durian with glutinous rice to a bowl - The Malaysian slang would be ""Power Man!"" - best Durian pudding ever. Actually I am a Durian fan, so I added this to the Chendol as well. -Fantastic. I need to thank Shah for recommending me to the Durian Tempura and helping me out with a helping.- Good Stuff.Well I cannot describe enough of the good stuff they serve, even the very unique grass jelly drink that Murthi got for me. My tip is Try It and Just Do it and you will understand what a feast is all about.If you are a non muslim go in at 6:30pm. The Fast breaks later. Eat slowly and enjoy, start with the soup, the satay, roast lamb with a little biryani rice and end with the desserts and a cup of Teh Tarik.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 11 May 2019 ,Amaya Food Gallery

"Darknight1522Orchard Road, Singapore",Great service-Awkward Ambience-Mundane food,"Dear Folks,Probably you would know from my other F&B reviews that I love food and works in same industry. Hence my reviews tend me detailed. Following are my touch points:Service Mix of local and foreign service staff who are all equally trained and performed well. Smile on their face, welcoming and prompt. LocationWithin 2km from heart of Jb city but this place this enjoy its tranquility as its located near residential area. Parking can be scarce and easily you would miss out the exit road leading up to this place if you are not powered by GPS systems. AmbienceThis is the pulling down factor of my overall rating of this place. This is my first time and I went here on Saturday at 2.45pm. Considered post lunch timing which I always try to avoid as this can be in between hours where senior chef will excuse themselves from kitchen. Still I went there as my wife was adamant in trying this restaurant due to her colleagues's trumpet session. But to my horror they allocated few families that dining in at this hours to a small private dining room which expands lesser than 16sqm. There were solid 16 seats in this room. This is the first kind of experience for me. If you are a single male and happens to have a Neighbour table seated by bunch of gals then I'm sure you would enjoy but that's stop there. No other group age or group categories would prefer that kind of seating that require you to literally whisper. At least the management should invest in a nice sound system so a melodic music or song can be played in such private dining area. So you can imagine pin drop silence in 16sqm space that filled with strangers. Haha quite funny but I don't enjoy that as me myself have quite a considerable loud voice. Business folks should ask where they will be seated when they place reservation. Nothing great about the decor of the restaurant as well. Considering the owner make shift a large bungalow into restaurant, I will expect for more of distinct decor character from such restaurant.FoodWe offered bru coffee, tea, paneer pakora, Village goat Dum Briyani, Garlic naan, chettinad chiken. Personally I feel the Briyani was good but not definitely nowhere near to the taste will leave impression. The rest was bland and my wife feels the chicken was filled with overpowering of cumin seeds and it tastes like rasam instead. After tasting those I couldn't agree more either. The horrible size of beverage was laughable. For beverage price 25% lesser than Jb Hilton, the amount of tea and coffee is quite on thrifty I would say. CostFew ringgit lesser than RM100 for the amount of food we ordered. Easily this is the most expensive Indian restaurant in Jb. For this price I would expect state of art food from all angle. RM6.50+ for coffee and tea is really exorbitant as well.That's all about this restaurant. Thank you guys. Kind regards,Guha Shan Show less",2.0,Reviewed 5 June 2016 ,Chakra
"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",The Spice of Life,"I've been visiting this restaurant for about 10 years now. It started off serving lovely Indian food at reasonable prices. However, over some years, the food quality deteriorated, prices shot up, some unordered items were surreptitiously added to our bill on several occasions....and so we stopped going. Fortunately for us, friends had started to whisper about how this restaurant had made a comeback. We decided to give the place a try last year, and we're glad we did. Since that visit a year ago, we have returned time and again. We have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries, sat in and dined, ordered take-aways on numerous occasions, and have always felt satisfied. Service is near faultless, staff (Manas, Ulfa, Ani, Veera, Mani, etc) can't seem to do enough to please us, turning dinner here into an almost fine-dining experience. The food itself is a mouth-watering array of both North and South Indian dishes. In fact, in my opinion, the North Indian dishes here are the best in the JB city area. The all Indian menu also has an extensive number of dishes. Prices are fairly reasonable. More recently, some food items have become increasingly spicy. Order wisely or risk scorching your tastebuds. This pork-free restaurant serves wine by the bottle. They also serve beer. Finally, this is an old bungalow which has been converted into a restaurant. Some of the dining-rooms are small and awkwardly built. Parking too, can be an issue. Don't, however, let that deter you from visiting. This is an Indian experience not to be missed while in JB.

Thus far almost every trip to Johor Bahru, we will make it a point to dine at this restaurant.

The chicken is really tender and the gravy is something which I think both children and adult would love. The restaurant has been around for many years, started from the stall then moved into the current location, before expanding it with another shop. What I really like the food here is that, it is so simple and authentic, like home cook meals. Like what mother will cook for her kids when they are back home. Other than the famous dish, do try the Sambal Petai, as well as the Fu Zhou Brinjal. The curry fish head is also good, if you like spicy food.

"CreativeSparkSingapore, Singapore",Craving Great Chicken?,"There are two restaurants side-by-side on Jalan Sutera Satu that specialise in Paper Baked (Herbal) Chicken. Both are wildly popular. Restaurant Bamboo (next door) has made a bit more effort with their decor, but other than their Paper Baked Chicken the menu is fairly pedestrian. Restaurant Teck Sing has made no effort at all with their decor, but they do have some interesting other dishes, like Black Bean Fishhead on their menu.Whether you like the chicken better at Bamboo or Teck Sing is probably entirely personal taste. Both are excellent. I think the dish at Bamboo is a bit more ""herbal"", but I like that. The one at Teck Sing is just as nice though.Service is snappy and you'll probably be eating within 15 minutes of sitting. The tradition here is for a slice of watermelon to appear at your table when you sit, but you will see it on your final bill (RM1.50). Plus, of course, the usual packaged wet-towels.It's a cavernous restaurant. Sound bounces around and you could follow the conversation at other tables if you wanted to, so if you see kids in high-chairs you might want to find a table a bit further away.Although the chicken was great, we were let down by the side dishes of kangkong (nicely crunchy but strangely sweet instead of spicy) and omelette (plain and uninteresting). The chicken-feet soup was great through, and a small serving was huge and cheap (RM5).The chicken (RM19) was perfect, and one is about right for 2 people.You'll probably be in and out of here for about RM25 per person plus drinks. It's a 10 minute walk from Holiday Plaza and if you like chicken, I'd highly recommend seeking it out. There's a good reason why it's so popular with locals.

"pauljerSingapore, Singapore",Head hunting for curry fish head,"THE best-kept secret in Jalan Sutera Satu, it is said, is its curry fish head.For the benefit of all of you out-of-towners who do not have a clue as to what I am talking about, this suburban area is located in Taman Sentosa, which is about a 10-minute drive from the Johor-Singapore causeway.I have devoured through many curry fish heads in my time, but this one I MUST blog about. The fish is fresh, the curry is rich and tasted right without you being overwhelmed by the spices. A lot of curry leaves are used to give the heavenly pot of curry a highly aromatic smell. Unlike the Indian and mamak curry, the Chinese fish head curry is neither sour nor spicy. It is sweet and creamy.Other than the curry fish head which tastd like a Million Ringgit to me, the main signature dish of the establishment is the beggar chicken Now, if you ask a hardcore curry connoisseur, the response you would probably say is: ‚ÄúAh?

"Matthew NPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",An Okay Place...,"I haven't been back to JB in over a year so when I did visit, my friends decided to take me to this place in town called Nuri's, a well known, established Balinese restaurant. They even told me that they had made the booking earlier as this place was so popular even with Singaporean visitors that it's always full and walk-ins sometimes don't get a table.Upon arrival we were fortunate enough to get a parking just in front as my friends had a young toddler to manage. The exterior of the restaurant gave me the impression that this would be one of those hip places like the one's in Bangsar, KL, appealing to the elite or upper middle class residents of the area.The interior ambiance also did not disappoint. The table's and chairs were very in themed with the restaurants. The waiters also had that TGIF feel. Now to the dishes. To share my friend ordered the famous ribs, gado gado and also assorted gourmet sausages. I ordered the bebek combo (duck).The ribs lived up to it's reputation. It was tasty and the meat was tender, fall of the bone kind of quality. So thumbs up for that. The gourmet sausages was also up to standard, but no surprise there.The duck dish was a disappointment. While it was crispy, I think they may forgotten to flavor it properly or like many busy eateries at times didn't marinate it long enough. I have eaten much better before, like at Ole Ole Bali in Empire Subang in Selangor. So this was not at all up to standard.Finally the Gado-Gado. Having watched You Tube's Mark Weins Indonesian tour and one whole episode dedicated to Gado Gado, I was very eager to try my first gado gado. I don't know maybe it's suppose to have that sourness, but I really did not like it.I have also read other Tripadvisor's comments on the waiter's not being attentive and I have to concur with their assessment. I guess it is always hectic and busy, and it's not easy for them to keep up with the busyness of the night but I think a better training program to prepare them for many many nights like this would be better.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 2 November 2016 ,Naughty Bali

NO, this also does not exist in Italy! Maybe in some posh Singapore hotels but it's not Italian.A restaurant in Italy does not have a wine list with bottles from all over the world.

NO, even if it could be very good wine!I read in the comments that some customers left bad reviews because the coffee was not as good (as you would expect from an Italian restaurant). Sure !

Taste and presentation-wise was excellent - great job from a Malaysian team in the kitchen! I had to take a picture with them. But here are the problems: I came with the intention of ordering a second main dish as well but changed my mind as I sat in the restaurant for the following reasons:1. The menu was not well-thought out by the owner for customers who‚Äôll like to go for 3-course meal. Too much similarity in base tastes between the pastas and the mains - a lot of tomato base!2. My pasta dish costs RM78.90. Seriously? Restaurant does not feel fancy. I‚Äôm aware that the ingredients are not expensive in Malaysia at all. 3. Also turns out the owner is neither a chef nor an Italian but claims to be the head chef. He‚Äôs just a German businessman with a few restaurants in JB under his sleeves and wasn‚Äôt friendly when I tried chatting with him. I had the intention to try out Sweetwater Mediterranean Restaurant along the same road but when I found out that it belongs to the same German owner, I cancelled my plans.

singaparadox,Stephanie saved the day! ,"I wrote a negative comment in Apr because I'd a really disappointing visit. Food was rather average, nothing to wow about. The drinks were horrid, yucky tasting cocktails which tasted nothing like alcohol but merely concentrated juice. And the grumpy waitress (Filipino lady) did not seem to be bothered at all when we told her our feedback.We were so disappointed that day and so I wrote a bad review there and then before we left. But just as we were leaving, the manager asked us about our dining experience. We told her about the cocktails which we didn't even finish, we merely took a few sips. We also recounted the waitresses' attitude.Upon hearing our story, she invited us to the other dining area (cocktail bar) and made us special cocktails. I couldn't edit my post that day because of Tripadvisor's policies not allowing 2 posts in the same month. I wanted to post thereafter but slipped my mind. I'm here to revise that post today, just to be fair. I believe the nice lady at the restaurant is called Stephanie. She made us feel so much better and an otherwise lousy experience, a worthwhile one. She rendered really good service and was patient and kind. A gem in the service industry.

"HaruKenchiruKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Average and not as good as most of the reviews said ,"I decided to pay this place a visit as I craved for some fine Italian spaghetti tonight and so happened I came across those good reviews about this restaurant in the state of Johor. I chose the much reviewed mushroom soup and the fried calamari as my appetiser. And for my main, I chose the seafood spaghetti (but changed it to aglio oglio since I liked this type). I had cappuccino for my caffeine dose. This is a review which I honestly said is not biased in any well so that my readers can get the real experience as close as possible. To be fair, everyone taste and preference are not similar. For a start, the mushroom soup really doesn't look that enticing but the taste was surprisingly good !!! I dipped some of the bread with it and it tasted really nice !!! Really a lot of reviews said the mushroom soup was great, which I do agreed. Next I had fried calamari. It was just right when it was hot and slightly less tastier when it got cold. The calamari was a simple dish, and Gianni one is just normal. You probably can get them in any Italian restaurant and caf√© with similar taste. For my main, that was quite a disappointment. I usually had seafood aglio oglio whenever I travelled to different countries, and I must say I have had better ones even in non Italian restaurants. The taste generally was ok and above average but the downside was the freshness of the prawns and the scallop. The king prawns and the scallop were not fresh and tasted bland, the texture were not tangy at all (pointing to it not being fresh). In contrast, the mussels were very fresh and taste good. And for the cappuccino, some earlier reviews said it was not nice and very watery. Gianni definitely has made the improvement as the cappuccino looked and tasted good. Overall, I would say I will not make a second visit if I am going to have the same main dish that I have tried unless they make sure the seafood are as fresh as it can be (that's the most important criteria for seafood aglio oglio). I couldn't comment on other dishes, to be fair, perhaps the others are really as good as it was said. You can try to visit this place for their other dishes but if you want to try the seafood dish, please ask if the seafood are indeed fresh !!!The price are slightly on the high side, being an Italian fine dining restaurant, so I do expect better quality which unfortunately wasn't. That is why I rated it as an average experience. Hope they make the necessary improvement so that I can be convince once again to give them a second try !!!Show less",3.0,Reviewed 30 November 2016 ,Gianni's Trattoria

I got lucky as the restaurant had just gotten some wagyu beef and that was the special for the night. Met the Chef proprietor, Hans Durst. again, lucky break, as he came to recommend some excellent dishes and wine.Started of salmone affumicato - smoked salmon, served with corn pancakes, and capers. Lovely...but find the rose decoration a bit cliche and lame...very asian style. It was also a very generous helping for a started. But I didnt mind as I took my time to also enjoy the food and the place itself. And as recommended I had a lovely Greywacke Pinot Noir 2011, beautiful New Zealander wine...extravagant, but definitely best choice. Yes, not the usual type you'd have with salmon, but it was more for the delicate wagyu beef main I had. Western Australian Wagyu Top Butt steak with musclun wazabi with red current reduction. This was not on the menu, but I asked the chef for his opinion, as I could not take too much after all the salmon. It was delicious. rare as I loved it, it was a beautiful dinner accompanied by the delicious wine.I then ended the night with My favourite affogato. Home made gelato drowned in espresso...was a great combination.Overall, I'd say I had a wonderful night even though I was there eating alone - here for work, but had to have a good meal after all the stress.

More cool, much more stylish, crowded with expats, reservations were necessary, and the experience was almost ""fine-dining"" (utensils, plating, wine etc).Not anymore. The restaurant looks tired, the furniture old, the menu outdated. Its customers look sloppy as well (where have all the stylish folk gone??).The food however, is still good. Maybe a wee less authentic to better suit local palates. The starters, pizza, pasta and mains were above average, and the wines were as good as ever. Their desserts are very good and I especially love their hazelnut cake with ice cream (perfect after consuming a thin crust pizza which has been liberally sprinkled with cili padi...sacrilege, I know!).

"JIA SHEN LJohor Bahru District, Malaysia",Indign service charges,"It was weird to see some of their dished were named with Italian, while others were named with English. Hence, I raised my question to the waitress who was taking our order. Maybe, the waitress didn't hear my question so I piquantly order one ""spaghetti with assorted seafoods"" (the listed name was spaghetti ai frutti di mare), Then, the waitress responded me with a sarcastic smile. My thought was filled with ""LOL"".After that, I ordered one macchiato and asked ""is this macchiato a small cup of double or single espresso with minimal milk inside?"". She answered me ""no"" and told me ""it is a very small cup of single espresso with some milk inside"". I knew I was not fulfilling a formal dress code (e.g. short and slipper), but it didn't make any sense for the waitress making coarse fun on me.Spaghetti ai frutti di mare and fettucine bolognese were delicious, but they could make the bolognese sauce less salty. Seafoods were fresh and succulent.Quattro stagioni with the base of thin crust was a failure of that night. The pizza base was not crispy, and limp, even though we ate it immediately. Usually, Quattro stagioni will separate four main ingredients into four segments while Gianni Trattoria mixed them together. This approach didn't offend me since I like their paste and mix.Hot chocolate was nice and valued for money. Macchiato was only ok although they used illy coffee beans like others. The combination of ingredients of the tiramisu was perfect but the sponge cake layers of the dessert were over rheumy. Total damages for that night were around RM 190 for two sets of primo, one pizza, two cups of drink and one dessert.Conclusively, service was below par and foods were nice though. One common problem of having meals in Johor is that most (yes, most) restaurants charging premium prices in Johor were treating customers sub-par in comparison with the same tier of restaurants in KL.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 7 July 2014 ,Gianni's Trattoria

"ShasharinaShah Alam, Malaysia",JB's saving grace,"After having forced to stay at dodgy hotel New York in JB (due to work placement), dining at Gianni's Trattoria was indeed a treat. There are 2 Gianni's in JB, and I have been to both. I must say, the food quality maintains the same - exquisite. I visited Gianni's in Pelangi a few years back. This trip, I got to visit the branch in Permas Jaya. And we tried quite a variety of dishes and they were all great, and ranging between RM20-RM130.As always, breads were served first with the balsamic and vinegar dip. Even that simple bread was to die-for. Excuse my non-fine-dining lingo. From salads to soups, and ending with desserts, every dish was like a journey to heaven. We had char-grilled baby octopus, and caprese with mozarella and roasted zuchinni; smoked salmon with corn pancakes and even caesar's salad. But the best was the brodetto, venetian seafood soup. Malays would love this as it's almost similar to Assam Pedas. It was definitely filling enough before the main course arrived. For main course, I would definitely recommend the Cod on pumpkin mash with black truffle. The fish was cooked to perfection and I honestly wanted more. I also got to taste the Grilled sirloin steak - beautiful medium rare as ordered; and even the Risotto with Salmon was very appetizing. For dessert, we ordered Tiramisu and Affogato. Personally, I loved the Affogato more. I would've preferred the Tiramisu in a glass and probably less cakey. But it was still delicious, nonetheless.As for service, dont expect top notch. I mean, this isn't exactly KL. And from what I heard, is far pious too. They were pleasant to me. Though you wont get them to recommend, because obviously they would say everything is good there.So, overall, I think Gianni's Trattoria serves good Italian dishes. Hey, if the Sultan would patron it, I dont think they'd serve bad food. For me, I would definitely come back for more. And to be quite honest, if I was staying in Singapore, I'd go to Gianni's for dinner too. It's worth the trip up.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 27 March 2014 ,Gianni's Trattoria

The food had been lovely and while one of the waitresses always looked to be in a bad mood, the service was generally good. That is until tonight. Three of us were dining in with pizza, two fruit juices and a glass of house red. The wine glass accidentally got knocked over during dinner and broke and - get this.... they charged us 25RM to replace it!!! For a restaurant with a menu as expensive as it is - I have NEVER been charged to replace a broken glass - EVER. The waitress was extremely rude - making us clean up the glass and offering us nothing to clean the table cloth. Only coming over to tell us we owed her for the glass. When we got the bill - there was the added cost of the wine glass, with government and service tax added on top!!! What a disappointment and rest assured - our friends and I won't be back.

"SARALAEJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Good: food+ambiance+service,"I am a big fan of western food and frankly speaking I found these 2wonderful restaurants in JB town and one of it is Gianni's. Another one is Sweetwater (check out my review on sweet water still my no1 fav) I have been to Gianni's restaurant a few times and this is my first review for this restaurant. I used to go to the one in Jalan Serampang, Taman Pelangi, however there is another new outlet in Permas Jaya now, which is nearer to where I live. They are open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner. It is located right opposite the Jusco Permas. Talking about this restaurant my first point would be the wonderful service.Personal attention from the waiters makes you want to go back to this place.They give you what you want. Replace your mash potato to a salad NO PROBLEM! Want extra sauce to your dish absolutely no issues. Well that is the kind of service you want and flexibility to have a wonderful meal. After all you arepaying for your food and you want to have the best. Well I know of all other things here the food matters the most. Trust me you will not bedisappointed. Experienced chefs at this restaurant bring to your table some amazing flavors, with fresh ingredients. Conclusion: real good food. Not forgetting the tantalizing desert!I am a chicken person and fussy and selective when it comes to seafood. I am not so much of a fish person, but I simply love their salmon grill and also the black cod with prawn. This is one of the restaurants that I am not afraid to order a seafood dish. Well my last visit here was over the weekend. I had the salmon and replaced my mash potato to some grilled vegetable. Well I wished they had added in a bit more of the veggie as it was way too little. And the salmon was amazing with a crispy skin and I ate it all ( I hate fish skin). However I found no sauce in it and the pesto sauce was not giving much to my taste buts. So I requested for a similar one that they usually give for the black cod and prawn dish. It was wonderfuland It made the meal complete. Do try it. You may also want to try the lamb cutlet and don't forget the Tiramisu. The best I have had so far. However I was a little disappointed with the chlorine smell in the drinking water. Well they had the same issue the previous time I visited. I am sure many have complaint about it. I wonder how they still serve it to customers. We did complain and they gave us mineral water I guess. But it was a bit disappointing when u get the same issue on all tour visits. This I purely the lack of understanding from the staffs working there. Need to get that right! As a conclusion, well some minor hiccups are acceptable when u get what you want. Yes you pay a premium price for the food. But it comes together with many other important factors. Nice ambiance. Simple and elegant set up. Good crowd definitely good food with great selection, not forgetting the range of wine and other drinks. Nice place for a date or a family lunch/dinner. Plenty of parking spots ( Permas).

ChidlomSingapore,Rather too expensive for what it is,"Had dinner here last week when we were over visiting one of the bridal suites locally. We had a selection of appetizers, all of which were pretty good. The grilled vegetable appetizer was unusual in that, unlike mosty Italian places, it was served hot. Seafood soup was full of good quality seafood items. We had a pasta course, skipping the meat dishes. A bottle of quite good Pino Gris went with it. The wine list has some oddly priced wines, with some wines I would normally consider as ""reasonable"" outragiously over the top. Others, by comparison, quite cheap. I recommend an overhaul of that.The decor is pretty average and the chairs looked like they could do with a clean. There is a convenient smoking section with chairs and tables outside, so smokers don't need to dodge traffic to have a gasper. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but somehow, this place doesn't really have an Italian ""feel"" to it.Overall the quality was ""OK"", but the total bill for a modest meal for three with a bottle of wine was close to Sin$250.

"CarlyA966Singapore, Singapore",Perfect Pizza in JB!,"I always struggle with ""good food"" when in JB (around twice a month) - I had heard of Gianni's before but hadn't visited until recently and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! I was craving oven baked pizza....not Domino's but proper Italian, tasty, mouth watering pizza! I didn't think it was possible in Johor - somewhere that excels in local food but lacks in the western variety. Gianni's was brilliant - service was spot on and the pizza's were excellent. It is a little pricey for JB but it is what you expect and you 100% get what you pay for. If you would like to RM 10 then go to a hawker centre - you can not expect food of this quality to be super cheap!! We ordered 2 pizza's (great size), 3 soft drinks and a salad and the bill came to just under RM 120 including tax and service which I think is great value.

MelodyJaneTanMalaysia,One of the best in JB,"This is a place I frequent mostly for dinner, sometimes for lunch.Loved their beef carpaccio. Most of the dishes are very good in terms of food quality and taste. I liked also the spaghetti aglio olio. Although this is a simple dish, I prefer it here as they tasted 'original' compared to some other restaurants.Bread is average.Pan fried foie gras sometimes available upon request although not in the menu. But they are not the best.Service..I would have to say 'unpredictable'. Most of the time is average. At times superbly helpful and friendly, at times a long sour face.If by chance you get an untrained person to serve your table, it'll be your unlucky day.

BillyBBarneySingapore,One of the Worst Italian restaurant I have ever tried.,"I am like everyone here, because of the reviews I gave it a try. Unfortunately, the reviews are not as accurate as what you thought. If you have read those previous posts and you believe what they said, you would think my review is total worthless. However, as what I have mentioned on my title, ""Gianni's Trattoria is on of the worst Italian Restaurant I have ever tried"" and I truly stand by it. Having been to many nice Italian restaurants, I have learned to appreciate the freshness of the ingredients and the simplicity of Italian food. 1. Beverage/CoffeeHave you ever drank a cappuccino that is foam-less, too much milk, no espresso taste? and when you see your drink being served, you started to wonder, if this is cappuccino or latte? So back to my point, would you spend money on a Italian restaurant that can't even brew 'True Italian Coffee'?2. Appetizer/ Entr√©eI had Beef Carpaccio for entr√©e. We did not have much confidence after we saw the coffee. And as what we expected, the beef taste frozen. 3. MainI had Risotto cook with Truffle oil serve with Grilled Chicken Breast. This is the only dish that I did like it (because I love truffle oil). However it was served half an hour after my friend finished her Pizza...!! What do they expect me to do when my friend's pizza was served first? Stare at her or steal her food? My friend had pizza. Because of my main was not being serve on time, I had to beg for a piece of pizza. Its crispy thin crust pizza, very oily and greasy. Overall, not too bad. 4. ServicesThere are a lot of them... We went there for lunch and the restaurant was quiet. We were basically the only table. Not sure why the staffs keep staring at us. I suspect because i complaint about their Cappuccino and they weren't quite happy about that. Before we step into the restaurant, i saw a lot of newspaper review on the entrance walls. Somehow the owner 'Gianni' was an Executive Chef in Hyatt Hotel? but that's his achievement not the chefs that he hired.... The decoration of the restaurant is really out dated. Full of dust... Overall, I really don't think i would recommend anyone to try this restaurant. It's just a waste of effort to try to find a parking lot for this.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 24 November 2010 ,Gianni's Trattoria
"dmymdNew Castle, Delaware",An excellent Italian Restaurant beamed up to Johor Bahru,"Last week visited Gianni's for dinner with our son and his girlfriend living in Johor Bahru, on hi recommendation. It's like a What Doesn't Fit In This Picture? Fantastic Italian food created by a famed Australian chef in a tacky row of shops. But step inside and savor the food. The baked chicken thrilled my wife with its flavor and tenderness she's not tasted before. The buffalo mozzarella in the caprese salad - tastiest and creamiest I've ever had. Mushroom pizza - after all the Asian food I'd had for 10 days- a welcome diversion - thin and crispy crust, tasty tomato sauce and intriguing cheese, a hit at the table. Sauteed spinach and garlic, I suspect slightly browned butter was the star, and disappeared fast. We went back for lunch. Waitress showed no emotion, but was efficient. This restaurant was rated #3 in Trip Advisor, should share #1 with Chez Papa, which we also tried. The food there was OK, not with a wow factor. But the intimate French cafe atmosphere, wall hangings and music were a Parisian transplant. Can Gianni's Trattoria just move into Chez Papa's space. Chez was good, but the Gianni experience was first and set the bar. Ohyeah, the prices are in Malaysian ringgats, way cheaper than the sticker shock just over the bridge in very cosmopolitan Singapore, where these meals would easily have been 3 times more expensive! 10% tip is normal and no more is expected.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 19 November 2010 ,Gianni's Trattoria
australiaguymelbourne,unexpected jewel in JB,"I was on business trip to Singapore and JB, I spent 3 nights staying in central Johor Bahru. My travel partner has family there and had some idea about the food hotspots. I told him I was feeling like Italian or European food as we had eaten Indian and Asian during our stay in Singapore. He rang up his dad who suggested we try Gianni's. So I googled it and found the reviews all of which seem positive with a few criticisms about wine list and service. I ordered a pizza and wagyu steak the first night...it was unbelievable. This steak was comparable to the best steak houses in Melbourne, and was served with a dark sauce that the head chef recommended and topped with duck liver. I could not flaw my pizza but the steak really stood out to me. Afterwards I went into the kitchen to thank the head chef, and i saw that it was 3 guys working in a tiny kitchen. It really pleased me to see that in the absence of huge and expensive kitchen appliances this guy is producing top notch food in something barely larger than a conventional household kitchen. I went there the next two nights and tried other dishes, once again my lamb cutlets and codfish were of a really high quality. Hard to believe this place isn't in the middle of Singapore or Melbourne. unfortunately I cannot comment on the wine because I didn't have any nor do I Know much about what constitutes a good wine list:S I also agree that the service could be friendlier but I have a feeling that may have to do with the language barrier.

We ordered a bottle of wine but it was not available and the Manager suggested we had a completely different bottle - and of course a more expensive wine. The wine list was not extensive at all, so there should not be an excuse to not have all the wines available. My steak was quite nice, but by then, we were not really in the mood.

"IshDewynKL, Malaysia",Fantastic food!,"Gianni's is without a doubt my favourite restaurant in Johor Bahru.The food here is excellent, be it the appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas or entrees. I have tried a lot of their food, ranging from soups to fish, meats, chicken... and I have yet to be disappointed with the quality of their food.My particular favourites are their pumpkin soup and mushroom soup, but perhaps the best thing about this place are their pizzas, certainly they make my favourite crust. Thin, crispy, slightly yeasty and doesn't absorb too much sauce, avoiding any sogginess. To me, their crust is absolutely *perfect*. I cannot say they are too generous with toppings, but for an average eater, it was just right. There are set menus are available for lunch, which are excellently put together for a reasonable price (approx. RM30++). The service can be a little slow during peak hours, so DO NOT go for a weekday lunch if you are in a rush as the place is always full then, but Gianni's has the perfect ambience for enjoying a long, slow dinner with your friends or partner. The decor is modern and comfortable. The waiters can sometimes give you a hard time, but talking to the manager usually settles any disputes rather happily. The owner is a friendly gent who sometimes comes out to speak to diners, and while that potentially sounds intrusive, I've never felt like I was being bothered. Romantic dinners and ""nice"" night outs are definitely recommended here!The lunch set menus are very reasonably priced. The ala carte and dinner menu can potentially be on the expensive side, depending on what you order, but I would say that on average, the prices are only moderately high. On average, I usually end up paying RM60-RM80 for my meal of an appetizer, entree/pasta/pizza and drinks. Still, for the food you get, it more than justifies the cost. I always leave with a smile on my face, a happy belly, and the thought that I must visit it again soon.Parking is a problem in the daytime, but is rarely a problem at night.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 17 March 2010 ,Gianni's Trattoria

Beautifully fresh and varied, the menu is small (which is always a good sign) and doesn't try and be all things to all people.

Most of the restaurants in this area are priced a little higher then other places, but worth you while with the kind of crowd that patronize them. Everyone minds their own business. They are civilized as well, no rowdy behavior. The music is light and relaxing, while you are still able to hold a conversation without shouting. All the waiters there are polite and helpful, however the same could not be said of the manager - Mr Narayanan. Very disappointing to have encountered him on our beautiful trip there. Watched him all night and it seems he only had time for you if you were a Caucasian. He was never interested in talking to us or taking our additional orders when the other waiters were all busy. He just went over to one of them and pointed to us. When he saw us paying with hard cash when the night was over, he rushed over and had this fake smile and was asking how was dinner and drinks and so on.

Nothing has changed except its environment and the menu. With a better premise of course, it is no longer as cheap as before but for many of us, it is justifiable. The new menu professes to offer the famous Ngee Heng Cui Kueh which used to be sold in a cycled cart in front of the Taman Sri Tebraru market. I tried it. The texture of the rice cake is nice and soft but the radish (or chai por) topping were a disappointment. For health fads they they will be happy for people who have tasted the original version, it ran flat of expectations. The actual chai por garnishing is no doubt oily and has a slight charred taste from the long-broiling oil together with the garlic and chai por. This version doesn't have the black sauce added and the taste only comes from the chai por.Back to wanton, there are new versions of green pandan noodles, and offerings of side dishes for extra order. There are also reasonably prized set meals. With all the new selections, I still go for the original hand-made wanton mee without spice and sauce. The wanton is meaty and satisfying, as against 'mostly-skin' in many other places. The environment is comfy as it is air-conditioned as compared to the old shop and in glitzy City Square on the 6th floor.

The late 80s then, I will drive across the causeway at mid-morning just to satisfy my craving for quality wanton noodles. What sets it apart from those noodles made in Singapore is the painstakingly hand-made 100% egg ingredients & very little lye water used to give it its crunchiness, unlike those in Singapore where the smell & bitter taste of lye water puts me off. Interestingly, my friend who swears by it & told me the story of how his dad had insisted that he drive to JB to buy him his fave meal of wanton noodles when he was in hospital. Sadly, it was my friend's dad last but very happy & satisfied meal before he passed away. Now I am back to JB after a 25 year hiatus, and I was pleasantly surprised that this noodle stall has found a new place in JB City Square.Yes, the crunchiness, taste & smell of the noodles does bring back memories of its original heritage, and though it is run more like a restaurant now (with expanded menu) I will still just stick to their original wanton noodles dry.The young wait staff are pretty responsive and courteous, and when we were checking out, asked politely if there was anything wrong with the noodles since one of our group did not finish the noodle.That.. is what I call well trained staff. kudos to the management.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 8 June 2018 ,Ho Seng Kee

In fact they have been coming to Ho Seng Kee since the 1950s, even before my mother was born. My uncles and relatives who have since migrated to Singapore come back to JB and must have their konloe mee fix when they here, and it's Ho Seng Kee.In my lifetime it has moved at least three times. Could be a few more, but I remember the stall when it was already at Jalan Wong Ah Fook, the days you had to wait for a long long time for a bowl, ok usually 3 bowls (2 Big 1 small.. and that's per person mind you). When it was there we would usually go there in between the breakfast and lunch crowd and we would see them making the wanton.... one small teaspoon of minced meat spread inside the wanton skin! That's how little it was! This I remember was in the early 1990s.Then it moved to Century Garden... and even then you would have to wait for a long while to get your favorite noodles. The MAIN photo here reflects the old place. Now its moved to the 6th floor of the City Square Shopping Centre. The service has improved quite dramatically of course. As in the time needed to get your noodles. Just like any other restaurant. Plus it is air-conditioned! The noodles still have that same quality.

"colourstreakKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Long Wait But Delicious Wan Tan Noodles,"As a JBrian, I vote this as the best wan tan noodle in town (and possibly Malaysia). Seriously, the wan tan noodles from Ho Seng Kee is a typical Johor wan tan noodle. Unlike the rest of the wan tan noodles around Malaysia (which is usually the black soy sauce, salty type), Johor wan tan noodles are known to be the 'white' type which is more plain. We do not mix soy sauce with our wan tan noodles. Instead, we mix them with a type of fragrant chilli sauce (nope, it's not ketchup) which is subtly spicy. Ho Seng Kee signature noodles are springy, crunchy and soft which mades them stands out from the rest of the wan tan noodles. Char siew are thinly sliced and wan tans are filled with good amount of fragrant minced pork. You can ask for the dry or soup version but imho, the dry spicy version is the best. So unless you can't even take a little spicy, do ask for the spicy one as their spicy level is really subtle. The downside of this restaurant is the waiting time. Honestly, I had never seen anyone making wan tan noodles this slow. They take an average of 30-45 minutes to prepare your noodles (regardless of how many bowls you order). Avoid this place if you are in a rush or if you are very hungry. The best time to go will be non peak hours on weekdays. They mix the noodles, char siew and wantan together in the dry version and is serve with a clear soup. While the bowl of wan tan noodle is really delicious, the soup is pretty bland to me though. Prices for wan tan noodle is consider expensive especially since their portion is pretty small. Drinks here are exorbitantly charged as well. So, really the only thing worth waiting in this shop is their dry spicy wan tan noodle. Yes and for that, we are willing to wait 30-60 minutes. Tip : You can call up to pre order take aways. That will save you more time. However, phone reservations are only available for take aways.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 23 August 2014 ,Ho Seng Kee

Jacket99Kuala Lumpur,I long to eat these noodles,"Probably the best wan tan noodles in the world.I really shouldn't be telling you this. I should keep it secret. The queue for these noodles is long enough already - you can wait for an hour before you get to enjoy them. But Ho Seng Kee deserves all their success, so pull up a blue plastic chair and order a bowl of XXL.Hand-made every day, to a recipe passed down from father to son, Ho Seng Kee has been serving the same amazing noodles for over 40 years.The stand-out feature are the wheat noodles themselves. Made fresh daily with the finest flour, they have a flavour and texture that only home made noodles can achieve. They are thin and flat (about 2mm width) but also quite strong, giving them a great texture for chewing. The pork wan tan are tasty, with a delicate dumpling skin. The char siew is sliced very thinly and served dry on top. You can have your noodles with or without chilli sauce. It comes with soup on the side.No MSG or other nasties. Just honest ingredients made exactly the same reliable way, every day.Open 6 days a week (closed on Tuesdays), you're recommended to go early (8am) if you want to avoid the queue. You can also take away, but be prepared to wait up to 2 hours.Don't go too late - once the days noodles have gone, they've gone. That's normally by 1pm and certainly by 2pm.I've been enjoying these Ho Seng Kee noodles for 6 years now. It is the first place I go when I come to JB.

But most of the time, we would order the hotpot soup. Service from staff varies. SOme are friendly, some are just take your order and go. I often see different faces on each visit. Perhaps their staff turnover rate is high. The only thing I wish they would change is their sofa. The sofa seat sinks in when you sit on it.

Arashi took an unusually long time to prepare its RAW food. There was a bell at each table for one to press to request for service, again, it usually took a long time for a staff to react to it. When ordering food, we were usually greeted with an unsmiling face. We obtained an undiplomatic and abrupt answer from a unenthusiastic staff with a stern, non-smiling face whom we think was Arashi's own restaurant manager the 6th time when we patronized the restaurant.

"dom2409Singapore, Singapore",The Replacement Lodge that needs to Replace its staff.,"I like to consider myself a pretty easy going, amiable fella but this morning's experience at this seemingly cute little caf√© in Johor Bahru's Heritage Walk area just pushed me over the brink. I arrived at about 9.55 am to be greeted by 3 staff members who told me that the caf√© was not officially open until 10am but I could take a seat and wait. So I thanked them and wandered into the second seating area with the intention of setting up by the window close to a power source. I took up a 4-seater table by the window, powered up my Mac and logged into the free wifi. About 10 minutes later a young girl took my order of a cafe mocha and I started working. It has to be said that this 'hip n' trendy' cafe also has hip and trendy prices. (aka as expensive for Malaysia) My 11 ringitt mocha arrived in a small cup with the usual 'hipster barista swirly milk decoration.' After a further 15 minutes another young girl asked me if I wouldn't mind moving to a 2-seater table as there were apparently a lot of people wanting to sit down. She said there's a 2-seater table on the other side. So I politely agreed and packed up my stuff and was beginning to move when the waitress told me to stay put until they'd prepared the table. After 10 minutes of further waiting I went through to the other side and asked the girl what had happened to the table? She said someone had taken it and there was no further space. I decided rather than hunt around for another space next to a power socket I'd just leave. The ineptitude of the staff and their inability to source another table or have the decency to tell me just totally blew my mind. I can accept everyone makes mistakes but for god's sake just 'communicate' clearly to your clients what you want them to do. I'm sorry to say but so many of these places are run by young, inexperienced kids who haven't got a clue what to do when there's the need for a 'think out of the box solution'. I've got no problem with trendy, cool caf√©s but please just use some initiative and sort out simple seating logistics - is it really that difficult? I hasten to say I won't be going back to this silly little place. It had so much promise but alas it's fallen well short of the mark.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 18 June 2019 ,The Replacement - Lodge & Kitchen

488lawrencelPerth,Unfriendly Cafe,"On 8 April 2018, my wife, daughter, son-in-law and I visited the cafe after lunch. My son-in-law wanted a cup of coffee. As there were 4 of us and only 1 person ordered, my daughter felt bad and ordered a hot chocolate. My wife and I were too full to be able to consume anything more. A while later, my daughter sensed two service staff whispering and looking at us, and asked whether they were unhappy to have us in the cafe. A manager came to our table later and asked whether there was anything we were unhappy with. We then related the earlier episode. He then explained that there is a requirement for each patron to have a minimum order of RM10 and that it is printed on the menu. We explained that a patron will zoom onto the menu to order, and is unlikely to search for conditions like this. We suggested that such requirements should be displayed prominently at the entrance, so that patrons come in with their eyed open, and not tucked obscurely at the top left-hand corner of the menu. Also, staff should be trained to be polite and discreet. Obviously, the staff involved were badly trained, if at all. The manager apologised and offered to waive the cost of our orders. Of course, we declined and paid. Needless to say, we will never patronise this cafe again. It is a very bad business proposition when the owners are only obsessed with making money, paying only lip or poor service to patrons, by creating an unfriendly atmosphere, and employing badly-trained staff who become liabilities to the company.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 9 April 2018 ,The Replacement - Lodge & Kitchen

The food was pretty good too. I had the soft shell crab bao [RM29.90] and the smoked salmon benedict [RM25.90]. The presentation of the soft shell crab bao was amazing! Would give it a 8/10 in terms of taste because it wasn't anything too fancy but was decent in terms of balancing out the flavours. The wasabi mayo dip for the fries were also really good!The smoked salmon benedict didn't impress me much. Overall a 6.5/10. The smoked salmon would be better if it were thinner and I had hoped for a bit more hollandaise sauce as it was just drizzled round the plate. I didn't try their churros because the reviews weren't very promising. I guess churros are hard to find in JB so it stands out for others but as there're tons of good ones in Singapore, I gave it a miss. Overall quite a good experience here and I'd drop by again!

"FifidogSingapore, Singapore",Great place for Korean Barbeque!,"Bukit Indah has a small concentration of Korean shops. This restaurant is located about 50m from bus-stop where the CW buses from the Second Link drops passengers. It is almost back to back with another notable Korean Barbeque restaurant.This is not a fine dining establishment; the decor is functional. It is not particularly smoky.. So you might not feel that you have to have a shower immediately after, but a face wash might be nice.The sets are reasonably priced. Expect to pay 40-70RM/person depending on what you order. Sides dishes are many and part of the meal. So are the lettuce leaves and tea.I felt that the side dishes were average. Quite a few of the sides dishes, in particular the kimchi and sweet potato, were good. Others, like the chicken franks, were out of place. The meat was good, but not great. We ordered a standard set and did not venture to try the more pricey offerings.What shines is the service. The staff serves you with efficiency and speed. They will cook the meat for you over the charcoal grill. My only gripe is that they may have over-cooked the beef to medium where I am used to medium-rare. But perhaps most patrons prefer medium.After paying your bill, help yourself to 1 ice cream free-of-charge, per person in your group.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 28 January 2020 ,Jeju Korea Bbq Restaurant

We ordered:- Kimchi stew- ginseng chicken soup- seafood pancake- bimbibap- mackereland it was all very tasty. Given the options available in JB, this place must stand out.We later found out the owner is Korean when we heard her conversing in Korean with an Indian male staff! A nice bonus was the free wifi and ice cream which was offered at the end of the meal.

Each table has a candle and is romantic for candlelit dinner. For non couples, it adds to the overall good ambience. Most tables have a decoration related to Halloween.

I ordered steak, it was cooked perfectly to the percentage I requested and was super yummy. The vegetables were nice too. Usually in other places that I've been to, the vegetables are boiled in water and that's all, but over here, the broccoli and cauliflower are probably stir fried with butter as I could taste the butter.The only area for improvement is that the potatoes were a bit too hard for my liking. The staff at the restaurant were attentive and friendly. It was difficult to get a cab so we asked them if they could call a cab in for us.

They even recommended some of their best-selling cuisines and desserts. Food was great too but pricey. We ordered:*Lobster Thermidor(This was the specialty of the day and was recommended by the chef. The lobster was freshly cooked. It was tender too. It perfectly blended with the mash potato and the side salad. It was a must try dish.)Price was RM82.*Irish Salad(Nothing was special about this salad. It was just a typical salad with green veggies, sunny side up egg and potatoes. However, you could request any type of dressing you want.)Price was RM24.*Soup of the day(It was a tomato soup. Nothing was special about this soup too.)Price was RM11.80.*High Tea set(Their high-tea set was comprised with two scones, a sandwich, a cake and a choice of coffee or tea.

"agoh69Singapore, Singapore",Yummy seafood .. the best so far in JB,"One of the best seafood restaurant I have eaten in Malaysia. Located in Johor Bahru near to Horizon hill Golf club. Came here for Golf and have a great lunch . Food served a rather slow here as they have a practice to serve all food at one time regardless how many you ordered instead of one at the time. The Marble Glory - or so called steamed Soon Hock fish was the best as it was fresh and prepared when fish still alive. The salted egg crab another highlight - the meat is juicy and sweet , perfectly blended in with salted egg sauce made this a great dishes especially you can still dip in the fried bun into it. One other dish is the crispy chicken with squid paste was superb.. very yummy but do pre ordered as the stock is limited. The sambal or Chile paste cooked clam was great too.. worth a visit and the damage for 2 tables for 12 pax cost $1100 ringgit. A bit expensive in Malaysia context.. enjoy it .

The supervisor came and asked for our pending orders which we honestly told him the 3 orders. (2 were from 1h45mins ago and another about an hour ago.) He apologised and told the servers to check on our orders. Another 10 mins later, a server came and served us 1 dish which was not what we have ordered. By then, we were hungry and tired of waiting. My husband immediately walked to the counter and asked for the bill. The buffet was rm68 per person. But the supervisor couldn't do anything for us even though for the 8 dishes we had, it was only about rm100? That's half the price of the buffet price for 3 adults, if we had paid for the dimsum ala carte. My husband spoke to the f&b manager. He told us ""sincere apology"" and that the reason for the slow service was that one of the steamer was spoilt. But it was a 1hr45min wait! It did not feel like he was trying to do anything for us. He only told us to inform him when we are coming back again and he will make it up to us. Why again? If he had wanted to make it up to us, he would have done it there and then. With such an experience, why would we want to return again? He is not even giving us a reason to want to give them a second chance. The service is bad and there is no service recovery at all. It felt that the manager is just trying to shoo us away. So after 2hrs, we were upset, frustrated and still hungry. There is no service attitude in the staff. The supervisor could have brought some other dimsum over and told us to have something to eat while waiting for our orders. Instead we were just left waiting. The manager could have offered to waive for 1 pax, offered a discount for our next meal or something. At least it will make us feel better as someone is indeed trying to do something. Renaissance pride herself as the only 5 star hotel in jb but in our opinion, alot needs to be improved! Especially when Renaissance is such a renowned name and i have always enjoyed the stay and experiences in Renaissance in other parts of the world.

"simplytravelandeatSingapore, Singapore","Mixed feelings, you be the judge.","I was thinking of bringing my Wife to a good dinner to celebrate her recent promotion. After reading through TA, we decided to make this restaurant our choice for the night.We arrived at around 9.30pm and there was another table of diners seated in the hall. I can see that there was a small function going on at the private room of the restaurant. First instance I walked up to the entrance to the restaurant, I was greeted with a ‚Äúyes?‚Äù by a Chinese young gentleman who looked like the captain for the night. Of course, I replied a table for 6, 3 adults and 3 children. Not a very good start as I find the ‚Äúgreeting‚Äù pretty weird from a five star restaurant. Anyway, was lead to a table and that‚Äôs about it, he returned to do what he was doing and literally, we were seated there without any attention given. No menu and no one came to ask if we would like something to drink. That lasted for 10 minutes and finally, we waved our hands and asked for the menu. We placed our orders and I went to the toilet. When I came back in around 10 minutes, our drinks were still not served. Mind you as there was only one table besides us. And there were servers apparently setting up other tables. Maybe they were preparing to go home which I seriously don‚Äôt know. Whatever it is, I felt it was totally unacceptable from a restaurant of this caliber.Next came the dishes. We had ordered prawns in superior soup which was item 62 on the menu. When it arrived, I looked in and saw chilli inside the dish. I was puzzled and I thought I had made a mistake (giving them the benefit of the doubt) and checked the menu again. I believed the dish served was item 65 and it was indicated clearly that item 65 is spicy, prawns with Tan Hoon (glass noodles). I asked one of the helpful lady (forgotten to asked for her name) to check with the kitchen. And they returned to say that the dish served was item 62 (puzzled as it was indicated clearly that the dish was not spicy) and I can see red chillies inside it, and interestingly with glass noodles. Ok no worries, anyway I liked that dish but I ordered something that the kids could eat as well. Finally, I could not take it anymore with the level of service that we were getting and told the kind and patient lady server about my thoughts. Not really her fault but she kept apologising. I just wanted her to feedback to her superiors about what had happened. After a while, a gentlemen walked past and smiled to me (this is what I will look for in a good rated restaurant) and he asked if everything was fine and I took the opportunity to give my feedback again. His name is ‚Äúmartie‚Äù, hope I got it right. He managed to do service recovery professionally and that was really comforting to me. He urged us to come back again which I believed I will in view of his professionalism and the quality of the food served here.Next, the food. Top notch quality and taste. Those dishes were the ones that made this restaurant impressive (thumbs up to the chefs on duty). We travelled pretty intensively each year and always on the lookout for good food. And when we tasted one, we would be elated. This is one of the better Chinese restaurant that we had tried in Johor and honestly, it should be the TOP Chinese restaurant (in terms of food, not service). The prawns were fresh and cooked to perfection, tender but not hard. The Peking duck challenge is usually what you do with the meat after the skin. We chose to fried rice with it. The meat was not dry at all and was really tender (considering it was meat from a Peking duck). The corn soup and the Sichuan soup were both five stars standard! The beef with kailan was very delicious with the beef again, cooked to perfect tenderness! Ambience within the restaurant was commendable as well with that posh feel to it. Tables are not located close together and that is something critical to create that upmarket feel for a restaurant.If they are able to improve on their level of service to justify their status as a five stars Chinese restaurant, I‚Äôm sure one day they will be on the TOP of the TA restaurant list in Johor.Hi Martie, if you are reading this, good job and keep on doing what you are doing. The industry definitely needs people like you who are so professional and proficient in your customer service. You are definitely an asset to the hotel!I had given them a three, but that‚Äôs taking into account the service level. If it would has been acceptable level of service rendered to us during our visit, I would already given it a four! The reason being the fact that I will give the food a five.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 30 March 2019 ,Wan Li Chinese Restaurant

Taste is pretty average, didn't live up to the hype. We asked to fried the duck meat in black pepper sauce (a big mistake)Thus we rated the roast chicken over the Peking duckAnother issue was that we didn't know there is corkage charge when we bring our own bottle of liquor.

"MouMouHong Kong, China",Eclectically gorgeous ! ,"I read about this cafe and saw the food pictures. I had wanted to try their food. This was the first cafe I visited on Jalan Dhoby, ahead of any cafe. At my first visit, i was definitely not disappointed with the food. The fish and ""chips"" is so awesome. And their cakes is so full of wholesome goodness. I cannot fathom why anyone would say their cakes are not good. November 2018 is my 2nd visit to this cafe. I have been thinking of their lavender cake eversince the first visit, pairing with Lavendar tea (by the pot). AMBIENCEThe cafe is electic with recycled furniture. In fact, for the OCD, you might even find the place run-down. But I salute to anyone making a recycling efforts. The first floors is rather dark but has easy access to service & food. The upper floor (connected by a narrow staircase, hang-on to those rails) is much brighter and more spacious. There is even a balcony to allow you alfresco dining, surrounded lovely plants. Indoors, there is a glass door that opens to a much better decorated seating area that doesn't seem entirely make-shift. There's even a bed there! The cafe really needs to inject some fresh plants/flowers inside their cafe. Else everything looks dried -up and dusty... SERVICEIf I had not visited a super cafe (across the road) this trip, I might have rated this cafe full marks. But 2x in a row, I find the service in this cafe a tad lacking. Especially when you are sitting upstairs. You gotta walk down the stairs to get service. While the service personnel are all quite pleasant, they are not thoughtful in their service. That is, you have to ASK (instead of their observation of your needs, and provide). Hence, i took 1 star off the ratings. WIFIThere is free wifi here. FOODThe food here is good, and not the same old some old cafe type of food. It gives their opposite neighbour a run for the money. Love the cook's creativity and more importantly, the food here is nutritiously healthy. We had the avocado banana promegranate milkshake. It was sooooo good. Yes, i revisited their lavendar cake ....still so fragrant with the smell of lavendar. Then we saw their herbed lemon cake. Extremly awesome. Even the chocolate (if you are chocolate lover) oreo cake is super. PRICINGPricey by Malaysia standards. A tad above average by Singapore standards. We paid cash. Not sure if they accept credit cards. We are happy to pay for good service and good food. Their cakes is RM$15-16 a slice, and i know they are baked with great love (because I bake!!).

The only major critic I have is that the upstairs portion of the restaurant/cafe doesn't provide the ideal seating for eating a meal.

rantyrantsSingapore,Overly exaggerated food with brainless service staff,"Seems that this is the one of the few places in JB that serves better quality beef. WRONG!!! they are one of the few that rip you off blind, with these prices its better to have quality food in a more hygienic set-up across the Causeway. At least if you were to get hit by food poisoning in Singapore for sure the authorities will do something about it. I was there last year and the occasion was on the contrary memorable. I was working out of JB and a consultant partner of mine was looking to have a good steak dinner so i thought of treating her to a better restaurant and boy was i wrong. First up cockroaches running everywhere, once we sat down and water was not even served there was this little critter crawling up the side of our table. The girl that was passing the menus came we pointed at the critter she smiled used her hand to sweep it to the floor and swiftly placed a foot to it and picked it up and left. Next up more cockroaches, there was one hiding in my cutlery set, which I had to make not once but 2 requests to have my knife and fork changed after the ordeal. The service crew are more interested to ask you stupid questions at the wrong time. Clearly i was unhappy for the cockroach incident so please change my table to your best roach free one and not come almost every eight mins or so asking me on how are things and inquiring on the taste of my food. How many times must a customer indicate that they are not happy with his dinner to get some attention? The servers seem to be all former Makati, Jollibee recruits. They are trained like robots selling fried chicken with one style and one sauce only, even if there was a fire or earthquake during service that night their modus operandi would remain the same, even if the Pope himself would have arrived that night for dinner it would have been the same or even if the Pope would have died whilst mid eating there that night it would be even more the same. The place is dimly lit that gives that horror feeling even more, not knowing if that piece of what looks like black olive you are placing in your mouth is food at all. I had an even funnier incident with this restaurant during Christmas eve dinner where I was unsuspecting lead to believe when i was told by a close friend that we were going to one of the best steak house across the Tebrau Straits for dinner. Just shows why i say fast food service or call centre staff should never be asked to take care of finer food serving establishments.

"Rizal SJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Surprise!,"Was looking for a nice cosy restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary, so being new in Johor decided to browse through the net to see what was available in this fine city and came across Grill Bar... Called in to make sure they were open, as it was the Raya season, and made reservations and also just to double check if they were halal... as usual establishments like these use halal ingredients but because they serve alcohol..... you know the drill.... but so do TGI's and Chilly's so it wasn't an issue... When we arrived (after making a few turns around the Taman Pelangi area- Thank God for GPS) we were kinda unsure of the location coz it didn't exactly scream out 'great food here!!', in fact the exterior kinda reminded me of the local watering holes that you would find tucked away in small housing areas. But when we stepped in we were pleasantly surprised...Very cozy, intimate and friendly... suiting for the occasion laid ahead for me and wifey but yet still appropriate for families to have dinners and for friends to sit down and have a laugh. Staff was friendly and accommodating, asking if we wanted to be seated in other areas of the restaurant being our anniversary and all but where we were placed was just fine. Handed us the menu (which did look like it was made to resemble that of TGI's or Chilly's but not as nice) and glanced through the items offered, good selection... not too many (which could mean that they specialise their dishes) but enough to get you all enthused. But noticed that quite a few dishes were not available... oh oh?!?Many selections of steaks but being our first time we went for the rib-eyes... but then the waiter suggested that maybe one of us try the lamb instead and so we did. Had some starters and when the mains arrived we were very much impressed. The lamb was tender and just melted in your mouth, the ribs were cooked just right. Really took our time with the food as we wanted to savour each bite.. Really good......time for dessert, we ordered the creme br√ªl√©e and strawberries & cream... but when it arrived, there was a nice 'Happy Anniversary' message on the plate written in the powdered sugar and some additional pastries... wonder how they knew? Maybe the flowers gave it away : ) haha...

"IshDewynKL, Malaysia",Best-cooked steaks in JB!!,"Chef Gary & his team might possibly be the only cooks in JB who know how to grill a perfect steak, regardless of your desired doneness (although I feel they are being too kind by still cooking for instead of throwing out the plebs who order their steaks medium well & well done).I love my steaks rare, and nobody sans the Grill Bar team has managed to get it right for me in JB. Their rare steaks are so succulent that sauces are completely redundant. (By the way, those who also insist on drowning their steaks in sauce should also be shown out the door immediately).I've never ordered an appetizer or an entr√©e here I didn't like. The burgers, chicken dishes & steaks are amazingly good. Waaaaaay better than the over-priced faff at the Thistle's Hive Bar or TGIFriday's. The duck confit is divine. So divine, in fact, that the first time I had it, I went up to the service counter and waited 5mins for Gary to come out from his kitchen, because I just had to shake his hand and congratulate him on such a delicious dish well done. (Incidentally, he's a really nice chap as well. But that's hardly the only reason I love the Grill Bar.)Their mains are definitely their forte, which make their desserts seem a little bit of an anti-climax. Not that they aren't flavourful.. just that you'll usually hit the peak of your meal at the entr√©es. However, the chocolate fondant, cr√®me brulee & that waffle dessert thing should definitely be given a go. Yummmm.I've never had a problem with the wait staff. Service can be a little slow over peak hours, but they're always friendly and will still try to do their best by you. I love that there is a cosy camaraderie between the staff & the regulars too. As a customer, it makes me feel very welcomed and appreciated.Parking can be a real pain during working hours in the week, but post-6pm and weekends are generally a breeze.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 23 August 2012 ,Grill Bar

When we was seated, we were so surprised that we are actually sitting on their new dining sofa set. Everything looks so different now since my last few visit. This just like WOW! New seatings, new colours, new wall.....It's like a totally new environment. Esp the wall, covered with hundreds of cool photo frames with motorcycles, bikers and celebrities. To link up with the walls, they actually have a very nice Harley Davidson (that says please do not seat) right in front of the main entrance and two mini bikes in the dining area itself. To me this seriously relates a biker steakhouse to me!Mother's day set dinner was expensive when we ordered, RM78+ per set!!!!! WAH! We ordered 5 sets which includes Shrimp & Lobster Bisque Soup, Black Cod, Giant Scampi, Prime Short Rib, Wagyu Rib Eye Steak 10oz and classic Mango Tuna. The Lobster Bisque was very flavoured full but a little bit salty. Overall good! Main couse was excellent especially my Wagyu Rib Eye Steak Medium Rare, so juicy and tender with the taste of the charcoal grill. Giant Scampi so big like Lobster, when i asked the service stuffs, they told me this is fresh water shrimp that weights above 400grams. So NICE & JUICY! This is my first experience with big prawns and we all like it! Compare to the restaurants in my hometown Penang, it's like Grill Bar is so delicious and special. Anyway Mommy was very happy and had a very good meal but total damaged for 5 persons costs me RM539! But to us this meal worth every money! (Must be the Wagyu Steak i think so RM16/oz). Wa!

"JohninCumbriaCalder Bridge, United Kingdom",A refreshing new concept for JB,"Because of the rave reviews we just had to give this place a try, it certainly is a unique and refreshing concept thrown into the industrial wilderness of Johor Bahru and amazingly it seems to be surviving quite nicely, well beyond the critical novelty time period. Personally I was quite impressed and would go back again but not so my three companions, mainly because they said the food was nothing special and the timing was way off, in fact there was such difference between the delivery of the first two meals which came together and the second and third which were so interspersed that the first and second were almost consumed before the third came and the when the last one was eventually presented everyone else had finished off their plates. I tasted two of the dishes besides my own and thought the taste was great perhaps though a little too rich for my local accomplices, the dining room service was overwhelming with so many staff gliding around or busy doing something, the coffee was spot on, but unfortunately for my companions the kitchen delivery and dishes had let us down.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 17 March 2019 ,People & Places Cafe
"ChrisJR_liuSingapore, Singapore",NOT JUST ANOTHER CAFE REVIEW,"Isn't this just another hipster cafe or a celebrity-famed cafe? I wondered when I was browsing through the net, but interior seems pretty, based on photos. So today, I took my parents there for lunch, arrival timing was so perfect, we had table ready to sit without waiting. (in photos always got queue, with two oldies to wait isn't the most pleasant thing)  Greeted by a friendly lady whom sat us, then speedy water and menu service followed through. Their 'No rush' service gave us enough time to decide as it was our first time. A friendly smile from another lady approached us as soon as we were ready, without raising an inch of my fingers, let alone my arm (Great eyed, Spot on!). Food were served timely, beautiful simple presentations for amazing photos and surprisingly the taste were as good as it looks! (Kudos to the chef team behind those walls) Everything WEIRD happened from hereon. Normally, in an ordinary cafes / restaurants, when all food orders are served, service crews will normally be busy with other tables, or just bluntly ignore some of us who wave our hands for attention. They usually will not come near your table again until you signal the ""international wave"" to call for a very important paper, named ""Bill"", that's when the staff will come by willingly..... (just saying)  BUT NOT here at PEOPLES & PLACES Cafe, it was lunch time filled with guests, your team were super attentive. These fine young Ladies never failed to provide additional paper napkins for my mum (we did not request, no hands raised, no action, the staff came auto-pilot and drop off one additional piece for my mum as hers were soiled) and they came by our table constantly assisting us in topping up our water glasses.  I meant they provide a bottle of water on table upon seated (without you having to request) which is Great, Replacing a fresh bottle as soon as it runs dry is a WOW (note: Auto-pilot too). BUT they up the service level in providing the service of Topping up our water glasses at the table for a cafe standard is OUTSTANDING! (take note: The bottle is placed on our table, the staff could have easily ignored and let us self-helped) A Huge thank you to your service crews, either they've been well trained Or/with built in with great passion for service, They are an Awesome and Outstanding bunch of fine young ladies and gentlemen! They are the Gems that help make this cafe dining experience an extraordinary one! I'm terribly sorry for not noting down the names of the fine ladies and gents whom have created this experience (I was seated in the middle of the cafe with receipt stating C2, around 1230-1332hrs, 6 Mar). Please share my thanks to not just the few of you, but all team members on shift. Thank you all so much for the great hospitality, it was a simple lunch but you guys made it SPECIAL!  I'll be back again for more my great food and service!  Keep up the good work! Cheers, ChristopherShow less",5.0,Reviewed 6 March 2019 ,People & Places Cafe

Time of serving is acceptable, we dine without any long wait. I would recommend their signature dish, marked by a chef logo in their menu. And their rainbow salad bowl also another one I would recommend. Price tag is relatively on the reasonable scale, in a range of RM10 to RM30 per item.

"petrinajoanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Horrible Experience!! Again!,"Well... an update on my previous review.. Mr Navee from the restaurant had called me after seeing this review and even spoke to me when I went there for my friend's function. He seemed to be really kind and apologetic. Claimed that he has spoken with the management and they really wanted to provide a free lunch/dinner for my family. I said I accepted his apology, but he insisted that they had to give me the free meal to compensate for our treatment there. So I promised to take them up on the offer once I could get my family together.Fast forward to the end of July. And I messaged the mobile number given by Mr Navee if it was convenient to bring my family for dinner there that weekend. A lady called me back from that number and said that we can come and that she was aware of the arrangement. That Mr Navee was on leave (I did offer to reschedule to when Mr Navee comes back). She seemed in a rush to complete the call so I messaged to reconfirmed that it'll be a complementary meal.She said she'll speak to the directors.She then called back and said that they can only offer free buffet lunch if we wanted a free meal.

Called 3 days in advance to book a table for a belated Father's Day dinner and this person called Sohil/Malik said that vegetarian Kerala food was no problem and the reservation was confirmed at 7-7:30pm. He even whatsapped and called me to confirm that he had spoken with the chef and that it was all set. Imagine about half an hour before arriving there, I messaged and he called me back saying that he wasn't there but that he had already informed the people there. He called again while I was driving, so I didn't pick up. Imagine we drove there and with my family we went to the entrance and were told by 2 staff there that we couldn't go in. No reservations entertained as the restaurant was closed for a private function. Called the staff we were supposed to liaise with and he had the gall to say that's why he tried calling me a few minutes ago. Totally unacceptable!!! Kept defending himself and the staff at the entrance agreed that this Sohil was their staff too but that it wasn't their responsibility and that we should solve any problems we had with him.

"GLORYSGSingapore, Singapore",Average Food & Service So I Won't Come Again,"Visited the Grand Gem Restaurant last month in Feb 2017 as it was highly rated & recommended in TA. Surprised to see a sign that indicated ""CLOSED"" at the entrance but there was still a table of guests having some birthday celebration and it was still early at around 830pm. So we walked in to enquire if the restaurant was opened and the head waiter ushered us to a table. We highlighted to him about the ""CLOSED"" sign and said that he would hv lost us as customers if we didn't insisted in walking in. He replied that perhaps it was the ""children"" who have played with the sign but surprisingly there was none around.The restaurant decor was quite nice and looked more abit like fine dining with high back chairs and nice table settings. We had garlic naan which was ok but were disappointed that the chicken briyani was just average with few pcs of chicken and felt not justifiable for the higher price here. We had been to Amma Restaurant many times and the food there esp the chicken briyani was excellent and much lower priced but of course no ambience there. As for the masala tea, it was so bland and tasteless with hardly any masala taste in it that we had to complain to the waiter which was not even paying attention to our waving hands. They offered to redo the tea which we declined. Also we reminded them that they have not served our final dish, ""kadai or karai"" chicken and finally it came. To our shock, it was not chicken but vegetables inside and so we informed the head waiter who seemed to think that this was what we ordered. When we insisted that we had ordered chicken and not vegetables, he then switched the blame on his junior waiters and that we should have ordered through him rather than the junior waiters. What a joke to say that to a customer and without any apology for their mistake? I was totally put off by their service and didn't want another replacement dish and left as soon as we settled the bill.We have been travelling round the world in Europe, USA, Asia etc and have always trusted and relied on TA for their reviews esp for hotel and dining choices and most of them are pretty accurate and true to the reviews except for 1 or 2 reviews like this. So it's good to share our real experiences, whether good or bad, particularly for hotel choices as we won't want to be stuck in a hotel with bed bugs, uncomfortable beds, bad wifi etc and bad food and services in our dining/restaurant choices.

There was another large group celebrating birthday party and the amount of food served was not enough to cater to all to begin with. The mutton and tandoori trays were left empty for more than 45 mins despite repeated request to refill the food.Secondly, the roti jala ""live counter"" was just put up for show and there was not a single piece of roti jala served at all. Why call it a live counter in your advertisement when there isn't a cook at all?Thirdly, fruits served at the buffet counter was just a small plate of pale looking water melon, which was polished up within half an hour and never refilled at all.For the price advertised for buka puasa buffet (RM80), you would have expected better quality and portion served.

I rarely come because the food has never been great, whether it's lunch or dinner. I was amazed to recently see it ranked 2nd (now 3rd) among TA's list of restaurants in JB. There are far better restaurants in JB, Indian or otherwise. A good restaurant is one where you dine once, and keep wanting to go back. Absolutely nothing on the menu here had that kind of pull over me. In fact, the restaurant has been nearly empty on all my visits, and it's not on the radar of many of my friends and associates. It is however, a popular venue for private dinners and events. The lunch buffet today was no surprise. 2 varieties of rice (plain and briyani), 3 varieties of vegetables, with prawns, mutton and 2 varieties of chicken (one curried, the other a chicken wing dish which looked like it had been cooked in a sweet and sour sauce). The food was average, nothing stood out. Not even the chicken curry, which is a pretty easy dish to cook well. The mutton was slightly gamy, I didn't enjoy it. The coffee and tea served was not up to par. The deserts were better though! I liked the payasam even though it was a tad sweet. The Kesari was fairly good too. But really, if you're in the mood for Indian, Bharat Curry House, Kerala Restaurant, Ashoka, The Village Briyani, Chakra, Bindu Curry House and several more in Little India, serve more authentic and tastier Indian food.

This was a complete hidden gem for sure. The food menu is deliberately limited but the quality is superb as a result, I managed to get through most of the menu and not once was I disappointed. They have specials now and again, depending on availability of quality ingredients. The service would not be out of place in a 5 star hotel, they go the extra mile and make you feel very special. The bar snacks are of a very high quality and can certainly recommend the nachos and the satay skewers.Prices are not the cheapest in the area but neither is the location, quality and service.The bar offers a great variety of drinks and they will mix something special if you ask, and I assure you it will be delicious. The pool area has limited shade which is the only downside. The pool itself is fantastic and the bar opens at 1pm I think and goes right through to early hours. They have a big screen projector which shows onto the building opposite so you have a pretty large screen (the bar is not dominated by this though). An amazing place and if you are in Puteri go check it out, you will not be disappointed.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 20 July 2015 ,SkyBar Bar & Restaurant

"CarolyninAsiaJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Great Place for an After Work Drink,"We have been to The Skybar on various occasions. If you just want to have a drink after work and also for just a light evening snack.We decided to go along to the restaurant by the pool with great views over the harbour on two celebratory occasions - the first in March - our Wedding Anniversary and the second to celebrate my husband's birthday this month.On the first occasion the food was generally okay and we liked the food served in-between the courses to clear the palate. I had the lamb shank and this was a bit disappointing as it turned out to be tough and did not ""fall off the bone"" like it should. We were asked for feedback which we gave. Overall though it was an enjoyable meal.The most recent occasion was my husband's bitrthday. Again my husband chose the steak and I chose the chicken. The service was good and attentive. We did not order a dessert but they found out we were celebrating and bought us a dessert to share. We were very lucky on both occasions because we did not book and went along on the off-chance.What I also like is going for a paddle between the food courses - very cooling!The view over the harbour and towards Singapore are great - not keen on the mozzies though!Show less",4.0,Reviewed 25 May 2015 ,SkyBar Bar & Restaurant

Unfortunately same issue happen like what I face from the previous time. Is not open yet. So I leave my contact number to the operator so they will call me when they start business. This time round they call me after 1200. So I made my reservation for 4. At 7pm.Drove there while it was raining. But when we arrived the rain stop. As this is our first time to Puteri Harbour. We decide to search around and discover some new dining experience for future visit. The area is still developing with high rise building surrounding Puteri Habour. Some of the outlet are addy closed down probably lack of business. Several bar and bistro in that area. Can be quite competitive and happening during weekends. Took a tour in the hotel. After that we arrived skybar. I know we were early we arrived about 6pm.I expect they host at least seat us and offer us drinks. But they ask about my name and drinks, but never seat us. Yet inform me that I'm early restaurant opened at 6:30pm. Then the host leave the bar, I thought he is going to lead us to somewhere we can rest, but he just walk to the fitness center. I did my turn back to the bar and get myself an area to rest while waiting the restaurant to open.Beverage menu was presented and I also ask for the dinner menu, so we can decide what to ordered. 6:30pm we were direct to the dining area. As we were the first patrons we can seat anywhere we liked. Is a small cozy area that only have 6 tables in the dining room. We made our selection and bread was served. Their bread was awesome with 3 different condiment and. However a lot of insect wanted to fly into the dining area after the rain. Is not harmful but it irritates us. I ordered a lobster soup and a angus ribeye. Soup was great, but slightly warm, not hot enough. We had a tomato soup for sharing they did separate into 2 portion for thumbs up for this.Forget about the Amuse Boise was seared scallop with mango salsa. After the soup we had lime sherbet to clean our palate. Thumbs up for this as well. Main course served. Slightly too oily for my ribeye, as the whole piece of butter is on top. But it was cook to perfection. We ordered the dessert after our meal. It too a long time to served. Not forgetting the special cakes for my birthday.

The portion has shrunk. They even held back on the best ingredients - the fried fish-balls, kerang and ""taugeh"". There was only 1 lonely fried fish-ball, at most 3 pieces kerang. The price however, has tripled from the mid 80's - now Ringgit 7.50 verses then $2.50.They used to be a modest stall by the side-walk of the building.

Have patronised many of their other outlets in JB. Have never been disappointed so far.Service was decent and fast. Communication can be a problem as the staff speaks mainly in Cantonese/Mandarin. Be prepared to use hand gestures if the need arises.Show less,4.0,Reviewed 23 December 2019 ,Restoran Pekin

rotatingplanets,WORST SERVICE OF THE CENTURY,"My first & second (yes, especially the second) experience at Restoran Peking @ Taman Sentosa was dreadful and honestly, disastrous. We had our first meal on 27/10/19 at approximately 9:45pm. When we arrived, most items we came for (crabs, suckling pig, crispy duck) were sold out. Decided to settle over here for dinner anyway. 1. We ordered mixed mushroom beancurd tofu but what came was just plain beancurd tofu. (The staff did not take the orders down on a paper) We told the staff and they went back into the kitchen and added some mushrooms on it. Well, it taste terrible. WORST dish by far.2. Was finishing up our dinner so we asked the staff, ""Is our fish maw soup done cooking yet?"" She went to check and came back with a disappointing reply, ""The order was not being keyed in."" 3. Our supposedly hot tea came at room temperature. We understand that you guys were closing but yup, zero effort.4. Staff are super inattentive. It's quite apparent at this point but hold up! It gets worse. Will get to this later.I guess it's understandable to have occasional cock-ups during service sometimes. Also, since we did not manage to eat what we wanted, we decided to make another reservation for lunch the next day (WORST DECISION EVER). You will be surprised how difficult it is to catch the staff attention when they have at least 6 staff on the floor. 5. Staff walked away in midst of taking our order. (??????????) ""We want suckling pig. Crispy duck....."" (She walked away at this point without saying anything. No acknowledgement, no nothing). I told my friends maybe she went to the kitchen to check for the food availability. We waited patiently and when she came out from the kitchen, she simply walked to another table. Excuse me????? We were not even done ordering the food. We decided to order our food from another staff since she's so busy. While we were doing that, she came back and said like, ""I thought you guys ordered already?"" LOLLLLLLL WHAT? YOU TOOK OUR ORDER? Absolutely redonkulous.6. While we were eating, staff were clearing and setting up other tables. This particular staff threw the wet tissue across the table to set for convenience sake. Super unprofessional behaviour noting that there are customers around and considering this is a premium Chinese restaurant.7. We were finishing up our lunch when we asked one of the staff about our fish maw soup (we ordered it again as we did not manage to consume this the night before). ""The order is not being keyed in."" WOW SERIOUSLY AGAIN? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES? Please have the decency to remove it from the menu if you guys do not have it. Or try jotting it down on a paper next time? Cos it‚Äôs clear as day that waitresses here do not have great memory.8. Once we finished our lunch, all of us took turns to the toilet. We were diagnosed with food poisoning and personally, I was in and out of the toilet for at least 8 times that day. Unfortunately for my friend, he had it worse than me and had the runs throughout the night. (TMI -- I'm still having the runs today 1/11/2019)HONESTLY AN ADVANCED HALLOWEEN EXPERIENCE FOR US. HORRENDOUS SERVICE AND RUN-OF-THE-MILL FOOD. For the price point, you can get way better food and service elsewhere. Thinking about it, mamak stalls have wayyyyyyy better service. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 5 November 2019 ,Restoran Pekin

Sheng mian was not as expected but noodles were surprisingly flavourful and chewy. Soon hock was well steamed, roasted duck was good too (skin was crispy). Prices were reasonable. Services were ok, within expected standards. However , the table setting was minimal. We were only given a small plate and chopsticks. Had to request for extra plates and bowls for our Vege soup. Not much of a problem for us but definitely a setback to their service. Could have given an extra bowl with each plate and chopsticks to improve the customer's dining experience.

"mooman801Singapore, Singapore",If you can do simple food brilliantly...,"Late dinner after long day of driving and errands. Arrived at 9pm. Didn't want anything fancy but wanted good and simple Chinese food. Ordered the ""four heavenly kings"" or eggplant, snap peas, kachang botol (four cornered bean), and, petai (smelly bean) flash fried in garlic; bitter gourd soup; king of spare rib; steamed spring chicken in herb broth; and finally fried ""mee sua"" or fine noodle. For a sweet finish we had the heavenly fried durian fritter. Four heavenly kings. Excellent combination of vegetables with different cooking times but each cooked to perfection in garlic and garnished with deep fried ""hair bee"" or dried tiny shrimp. Highly recommend. 8.5/10Bitter gourd soup was a melody of savoury flavours and interesting textures. Thin sliced bitter gourd played so well with sliced Pork, egg drop style soup with flash fried shallots that really brought out all the best in each of the underlying ingredients. Yet soup was still pretty clear and tasty on its own. Very homely. 8/10King of spare ribs - essentially bite sized morsels of pork served in a tangy and sweet sauce. Meat was well seasoned and went well with plain steamed white rice. Meat could have been more tender. Sauce was a tad too sweet but overall worth exploring. 7.5/10Herbal chicken meat was fall off the bone and the accompanying broth chock full of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with supposed health benefits. Broth was good but a tad salty. 8/10Fried fine noodles had great ""wok hei"". Texture was right on the dot. Al dente. 7.5/10Durian fitter. If you like durian you'd like this durian fritter. Served piping hot fresh from the fryer. Yet the durian inside was still nice and chilled. Wonderful way to end of a late dinner. 8.5/10Service was decent but language was a problem. Come with a mandarin or Cantonese speaker or be prepared to grunt at the wait staff and poke the menu. Pictures do help. Toilets were basic. Squat type at least for the men.

macplastikKuala Lumpur,Old Hainanese kopitiam style chicken chop.,"Was in the area for work. Walked past this place, and outside was parked two cars- a yellow Lotus sports car, and a tiny beat up kancil. On the exterior was this copy: 'Best chicken chop in town'.Challenge accepted, then.Had the fried version for dinner, and then on the next day, the grilled version. The grilled version really reveals that the thoroughly prepared chicken isn't exactly the freshest. Or maybe the fried version is just simply nicer. Overall the chicken chops are not bad, but I want to believe that JB has better chicken chop than this. It's not a high end restaurant, so the service is very basic and to the point. You get pointed to an available table (I sat at the same single person table on both days). Then a waiter or the boss comes to you and passes you the menu, gives you a couple of minutes to look it through (there are more stuff than just chicken chop) then they come back and ask what you want, you make the order, then you look at their walls decorated all the old newspaper cut outs and photos while you wait, then the food arrives, you eat, wash it down with the beverage of choice, then you pay at the counter. In and out quick.The meal of a chicken chop and a drink is about RM20. Cheap eat for some, mid range for others. Probably very pricey for the manual labourer.Visitors to this place is best described as 'muhibbah', well mixed of all different Malaysians from all social strata, religions and ethnicities, and on both days I saw them coming in as groups of friends.

The chop came out as expected...crispy, the potato wedges were well seasoned. What's amazing is the chops were battered before frying that gives it the crunch. The wedges weren't from the frozen fast food stuff. The mee goreng was nicely spiced and so was the fried rice that has that tinge of burnt taste that how fried rice should taste. And the lime juice wasn't made from cordials. The bill for 5 person...approx. MYR100 (SGD33). The place is authentic is it gets. Plain simple. Staff attitude is surely pleasant. I suppose taste is very subjective. It's just my opinion, if I have to compare it to DOME Cafe where I had lunch, being served potato wedges that's out of the frozen section of the supermarket and microwave food and still have to pay MYR29 +10% service charge + 6% GST for that sandwich, This place would beat MOST such so called high class cafe hands down.

We reached at 11.30am, however the door was locked and it will only open at 12pm ! Quite a number of people are sitting outdoor waiting for their opening ! So dont be surprise if the door is still locked before 12pm ! We were there on a weekday, yet it's still fully packed ! Please expect the crowd and waiting time.A quick tips, they do serve sides like peanuts when you're seated, and they will be charged. So if you're not interested in the peanuts like us, tell them you dont want it ! Many mistaken that it's not charged.

"wolfiecocoSingapore, Singapore",Have the ham and cheese rice balls. They are simply addictive,"Their hot seller is the cheese bumbuk which is cheese with fried chicken and french fries on a hotplate. However, I find that their cheese bumbuk has very little chicken flesh and a lot of flour. The cheese bumbuk is suitable for larger groups, minimum of 4 pax. it will be too much if its just for 2 pax. Their Korean chicken is a little bland as compared what I am used to; like four fingers chicken has an intense flavour as compared to theirs. If you like chicken that doesn't have an intense flavour then this is for you. They are halal. For those who want to try a cool looking beer cocktail, they have a few versions of it. It quite popular and you can see it on almost every table. However, my massive favourite is the ham and cheese rice balls. It contains ham, cheese, of course, fried shallots, a generous helping of Korean seaweed, tobiko (prawn roe), mixed Korean short grain rice with red rice. Its seasoned with sesame oil and topped with a dollop of mayonnaise. How it is eaten is by using gloves to mix up all the ingredients and roll them into balls. Its super yummy and the portion is really a lot. If you are not sure how the staff would be happy to mix and roll them into balls for you. But honestly, the fun is in rolling them into balls. The portion is pretty large so, I would suggest that you could order that for 2 pax and order a side dish which was enough for the 2 of us.

My basic expectation is that hot towel and menu should be given when I am seated. Not only did I have to ask for a menu to be given to me, I was not given a hot towel even after ordering, eating and ready to leave. I may be a solo dining customer but I think it speaks volume when there seems to be an obvious element of bias / discrimination towards a solo dining customer. This is such a horrible experience and the reason given when I highlighted this matter was due to new staff on duty. As a solo diner who paid more than RM15 of service charge for a meal (10% service charge), I really expected a better standard of customer service.

We ended up ordering Ebi mentai maki, Grilled salmon maki (funny how they could still serve us this when they had no salmon sashimi), Chawamushi, and Fried pork cutlet. Sadly everything was a disappointment. The ebi is so dry and tough, the mentai is made of cheap diluted mayo and ebiko (How dare they name it mentai when they did not even use Pollock roe?!

"JIA SHEN LJohor Bahru District, Malaysia",Very packed,"My Japanese customers always made some jokes about the ingenuity of our local Japanese restaurants since restaurants in Japan were very packed and only one person may go through the passage in one time. Few days ago, I found a ""genuine"" Japanese restaurant in Pelangi. It was very packed and I was kinda lucky to find two seats (sharing with other persons) when I arrived Warakuya.Their service was very poor and ruined my happy weekend. First, they didn't serve me a warm tower after my order. Yes, they didn't serve it even one local Chinese waitress saw it and told another foreign waitress that our table got no tower. After that, the Chinese waitress rudely place a cup of hot tea beside me even though my right hand was just 2-3 cm beside the cup. I did say thank you after my order and didn't curse you, right? The story was not ended here. I asked another waitress why our dishes were not served although we ordered earlier than another two tables (I also order ramen) in front of and beside us. She just disappeared and spoke nothing. After few minutes, she brought our dishes to us and still spoke nothing about my 40 waiting time.Ramen and bento were salty and mediocre. Although their menu got extensive choices (e.g. king crab leg at rm 35, very good price), I dared not to order their sushi after I saw how they stored their raw materials in the sushi bar. Last, if your waitress could not speak japanese, please don't write your menu in katakana. This really makes those who really can speak japanese like a dumb in your restaurant since your waitress got their own way to pronounce the name of those dishes.Will visit its Sutera's branch in next week due to my girlfriend's and her mother's and sister's birthday.

"EveSarahSingapore, Singapore",Lousy food with high price,"I wanted to celebrate my husband birthday and since we are in JB, I thought we could go to a nice Mediterranean or Italian restaurant and we found this Sweetwater Restaurant. So I booked and we went. The ambiance is nice and soothing and parking is easy. The only positive feedback is the servers are attentive. What is not good is the food and the misinformation presented by the staffs. I ordered Calamari as starter, mushroom and onion soups, squid ink pasta and cabonara as main courses. The Calamari is almost tasteless except for a little after bitter taste which may have come from the generous herbs thrown in. The mushroom soup was ok but my onion soup is a disaster. I have never had such sweet onion soup before and when I asked the staff, he is very honest and told me that they put sugar... Why do you need so much sugar when the soup will be sweetened by the caramelized onion and beef stock/broth. It is the worse onion soup I have tasted. Then comes my squid ink seafood pasta and it cost RM$79 is I am not wrong. I looked at the pasta and realised that there is no squid ink and just dark grey colored pasta with seafood. I tried the pasta and seafood. The pasta is not cooked properly so it is hard and the seafood is tasteless and I guess they boiled the seafood. I called the server again and he told me that they ran out of squid ink and that is Aglio Olio but how come no one tell me...I was apparently very upset and I told the server to bring it back to cook longer for the pasta to be cooked and add cream sauce as it was tasteless. I didnt want to change the whole main course as I do not believe in wasting food. After a while, my pasta came back. All seafood now de-shelled and the pasta is with cream sauce. After one bite, I asked for salt as it is tasteless still. when the whole dining episode is over, we called for the bill. We were charged for Squid ink pasta instead of Aglio Olio. My husband then told the server and they amended the bill. This whole dining experience is bad. I will never go back there again.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 23 November 2018 ,Sweetwater Restaurant

WittstockJohor Bahru,Sweetwater Restaurant is the best western restaurant in Johor Bahru,"The problem with eating at a restaurant that has an interesting menu is deciding what to have. Thankfully my wife and I were rescued by the hostess, who calmly recommended a couple of starters, mains and desserts. Her recommendations sounded delicious so we ordered our whole dinner there and then.Not long afterwards the hostess, who turns out to be the owners partner, returned with a basket of hot breads straight out of the pizza oven. Soon after that a bottle of Durbanville Hills Cabernet Sauvignon was shown, opened and poured. The restaurant itself is modern, trendy and airy. Different sections have definite feels about themselves. Walls are artfully decorated with huge portraits of interesting characters caught in intriguing poses. The kitchen is shiny, clean and open; a definite plus on my list: I like to know that the place my food is being prepared is clean and I enjoy watching the chefs at work, it adds a vibe.Starters of grilled scallops set on a spinach Rockefeller with burnt orange vinaigrette and a calamari ripieni arrived. The scallops were delicious, the combination of scallops, spinach and the orange vinaigrette creating a very unique taste. Cindy's calamari ripieni in salsa di pomodoro all olio was equally delicious. The calamari tubes were stuffed with clams and a tomato salsa and I can't remember when last I had calamari that tender. Not having calamari, or any dish for that matter, crumbed, deep fried or spicy as hell, was a pleasurable change.Cindy and I were able to soak up the atmosphere, chat and enjoy the very drinkable red wine while waiting for our mains to arrive. The table next to us was a family of four adults celebrating the moms birthday. There were a few tables of couples and other younger families in the main sectionand in the bar lounge, hidden from view by the colourful glass bar shelves, a large table of bankers were celebrating something.Cindy enjoyed a Spanish Paella for her main course. We were both impressed by the generous portions of large prawns, calamari and cubes of chicken mixed in with the perfectly cooked rice.My duck was out of this world. The young rotisserie duckling was tender inside, crisp on the outside and the red cabbage, pear and orange sauce served with it was incredible.The waiters serving us were efficient but lacking personality. In fact, I couldn't tell you who was meant to be serving our table, they did not introduce themselves, never once asked how we were doing or if we needed anything, they simply just dropped off food, cleared plates and poured wine. Stephanie, however, was a great hostess, popping around with each course to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I'm glad that we ordered the chocolate-hazelnut souffle for dessert, for two reasons; it takes a while to prepare, allowing our food to settle and because it was to die for ‚Äì bittersweet chocolate, nutty, moist and served with fresh whipped cream. By the end of our meal the restaurant had quietened down considerably. The owner and executive chef, who had been busy in the kitchen up until then, went around to all the tables. He is a German named Hans. We had an after dinner drink and chat with him and he told us a few interesting stories of his experiences as a chef in hotels all around the world and of how he ended up in Johor Bahru.Overall, our experience at Sweetwater Restaurant was very enjoyable. The positives were:1.The restaurant is spacious, trendy and decorated sensuously.2.Suitable for lunches, dinners, business meetings, corporate functions, family occasions and romantic dinners.3.Hostess did a good job of making us feel welcome and had a thorough knowledge of the menu.4.Very good wine list.5.Basket of fresh, hot bread served on the house.6.The menu is extensive.7.Food was well presented, interesting and delicious.8.There is a waiting bar and bar lounge.9.Kitchen is open and the owner is the executive chef.10.The owner/chef went around to chat to the guests.The negatives were:1.Mostly centered around the waiting staff; didn't introduce themselves, didn't know who was meant to be serving us, they didn't interact with customers at all.2.The upstairs section of the restaurant is not completed yet, so there is still blue sheets covering up parts of the wall.Prices:(Given as an average between Cindy's meal and mine)Starters RM24.00Mains RM45.00Desserts RM22.00 * Prices exclude government tax and service charge.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 7 October 2011 ,Sweetwater Restaurant

"155thihasSingapore, Singapore",Unlikely reasonable prices ,Checked out this restaurant last minute and decided to give it a try. We had late lunch and the crowd was still strong. Even after we started eating there were still groups coming in. The menu looks like a mixed or fusion of western and Japanese. I may be wrong here. But the prices are reasonable for such place and of course the taste was more than good. The portion is not large but good if you intend to share and try a few main dishes. The fried onions was great. Those thin strips just enough to give you the onion taste without being too strong. The desert was nice but the mangoes were too sour. See photo. Didn‚Äôt tried their drinks as we were already too full from all the food. Maybe next time. Staff were friendly and helpful. More than enough to not have to look around too much. Food waiting time was short except the desert as take some time to prepare. So would advise you order earlier. The atmosphere is nice. Parking space was not difficult to find. Would visit again.

It has an interesting theme with motorbikes as part of its decor on the ground floor. On the top floor are pictures of motorbikes and helmets. It will be of interest to motor buff. Anyway let's go for the food. The mushroom chowder tasted wonderful and I really enjoyed it.I had the macaroni with salmon (just bits of salmon) in creamy sauce and topped with fish roe. Really good I thought. The rest ordered fish and chips and the chicken chop. Did not really taste it. I was told that it was reasonably good.Quantity wise the chicken chop was rather huge portion with egg, mesh potatoes & vegetables. The size of the fish & chips was just the right portion but taste wise it was average (I did manage a bite).

Just to share, my friends and I enjoyed the xo carrot cake, braised tofu. For mains, we enjoyed the wanton dumplings and soup base. However we did not really enjoy the wanton noodles which had a strong alkaline taste. To mask the taste, you can ask for their spicy belachan chilli and mix some into the noodles to consume it without wasting food. I also enjoyed the cold garlic cucumber which whets the appetite. We had cold luohan/longan herbal tea drink and a very rich iced milk tea. Beverage was satisfying and did not disappoint us at all.

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",North Indian food,"The Village Briyani Cafe first opened in 2006/2007. The briyani then was fantastic, as were the naans. The service was outstanding and the restaurant had many fans. It was the only restaurant at that time which served North Indian exclusively. From the beginning, no alcohol was served, which can be a damper. Still, I know friends and family from KL, who after finishing their work in JB, would immediately adjourn to The Village for the briyani. Now, it's pretty much an average restaurant serving North Indian food. Taste has taken a dip, the briyani especially. The chicken in the chicken briyani used to be fresh regardless of the time of the day, but not anymore. The rice too is no longer as fresh and fluffy as it used to be, with many of the delicate flavours missing. Very sad. The rest of the items, including the famous Village Naan, are still good. The Chicken Tikka and Mutton Rogan Gosh are good too. They also have a good selection of vegetarian dishes. Both the Paneer Butter Masala and the Chana Masala are good. The Gobi 65 which is deep fried potato slices with garlic and cauliflower is a firm favourite with my kids. The food here tends to be spicy and hot with cili padi liberally thrown in. It may be too spicy for some though, especially when there's no cold beer. You can, however, sip on some masala tea. Or better yet, have their lovely kulfi for dessert. The place is still comfortable, air-conditioned, nice decor, soft music, etc. In short, it's typical of North Indian restaurants around the world. The staff are now less forthcoming and friendly although service is still good. Prices have gone up (doubled even, with some items), but it's hardly expensive to have a meal there. The owners have opened another restaurant a few shops away called The Village Countryside Cuisine. The food there leans more heavily to South Indian, and it's good in its own way, with rice meals for lunch. Thosai, idli and poori are available for both lunch and dinner, as is traditional Indian-style coffee and tea with fresh milk. You can also order items from Village Briyani, though not vice versa. The restaurant is in a quiet area, right in the centre of the city. It's very close to the Glass Temple, and obliquely across Landmark Tower (Hilton DoubleTree). If you're coming from City Square/JBCC, you will need to make a U-turn at the flyover after Landmark Tower. If you're coming from Danga City Mall, keep left and look out for Bharat Curry House.

Suria_estlesoleilBrunei Darussalam,Just okay.. improvements needed!,"We came here after spending an enjoyable day at the Hello Kitty and Thomas Train theme park. Our son loves DC Comics and we recently went to the DC Superheroes Cafe in Takashimaya, Singapore which was wonderful in comparison. Some things that need improving:1. The photos in the menu are underwhelming, suggest to revamp the menu and get a new food photographer, nothing looked appetising in there. Not much improvement either when the actual food arrived - it lacked finesse in its presentation.2. Waiting times could be improved. There were only 3 occupied tables that day and we'd all arrived at different times. I know the pizza takes longer to cook compared to the rest of the food, but in this case, it took wayyyyy too long to arrive. We were 3/4 done with our other meals when it finally arrived.3. Both the pizza and the lasagne was good, however their red pasta was cooked with too many onions such that the taste was overpowering. Much could be improved in terms of taste and consistency. The drinks were ok.Some good points: The cafe is well-decorated and has the same concept where it adjoins the DC merchandise store which features a good selection of the latest merchandise. The kids enjoyed roaming around the spacious store while waiting for their food. Food prices are actually quite reasonable and the staff are friendly and helpful. Our kids liked the cheddar cheese cut in the shape of a Batman logo which is used to top the pizza - we specially requested for more of these (at an additional fee) which they happily obliged.So yeah this place is not all bad, but 3 stars from me until I see more improvements.

While waiting for the food, we roamed around to check out the figurine displays, life-size superhero mannequins and the super cool batmobile which is the center piece of the boutique.

EdisonLeeSingapore,Brings back memory,"Tried these restaurant 3 times over a period of years but deserves a review since we ordered from the ala-carte menu this time.Parking is convenient and that saved a lot of trouble from the usual street-side parking in Johor. Given that it is a fenced up parking with security on site, we can then dine in peace.Seafood is fresh and the atmosphere is great. Had a good time dining with friends. While eating, also saw readings of the live tanks being taken by the chef or cook. This tells me they are taking real care of the seafood they serve. The only reason why I gave it a 4-star instead of 5-star is that I felt they should have taken better attention that we ordered our noodles without prawns, since one of my friends was allergic to prawns. Had to get them to re-cook a new serving and they did it with a replacement with fried fish. Otherwise, servers are very attentive and sharp-eyed.

For one, crabs, a firm favorite among seafood diners in Malaysia and Singapore, are set at a so called 'market price'. You would like to think this would be the Johor market price. When we went, this price was RM120 per kilo of crab, which would be the ""market"" price you'd wonder which market? Tokyo? New York? Singapore? London?Secondly, where possible, the restaurant uses cheap tricks. Scallops: In our case, frozen ones were used in the braised scallop (RM40 per serving). The sweet-corn crabmeat soup: Ours used crabstick instead of crabmeat. When we challenged the hostess she gave us the explanation that this was after all only a RM12 soup (and most customers don't know the difference anyway). The szechaun chilli chicken? The chicken tough, over-fried, over-glazed in an odd way. The only parts of the order that did justice was the pepper beef - the beef was succulent and well prepared; and the prawns fried in cereal.

Angie K,Review of Vivo American Pizza,"Vivo is a young American brand that serves a range of pizzas, pastas, baked dishes, seafood/ meats, and desserts. Like the case with Tea Garden, we were in a dilemma whether to include Vivo in our reviews, since it is quite common in Malaysia, and we‚Äôve visited it so many times. We usually frequent the outlets at Setia Tropika and Tebrau JUSCO in Johor Bahru, and hang around to do some work/reading while enjoying a nice meal.Overall, if you are looking for western food, want a clean, comfortable and modern setting with consistent food and service quality, this is good place to go. The only downside is their relatively higher prices by Malaysian standards.A meal there (2 mains and a drink and/or side) typically sets 2 of us back around RM50. They usually have ongoing lunch and tea-time/ dessert promotions (which are updated regularly).Generally, this is a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù outlet to visit because of the consistent quality across its wide range of menu items. While we haven‚Äôt found any outstanding items on the menu, we love the clean, bright and comfortable setup, and the reliable service.For reviews and pictures of the food items that we have tried, refer to our blog: https://angiekayexplorer.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/review-of-vivo-american-pizza-panini-johor-bahru/Show less",4.0,Reviewed 21 March 2015 ,Vivo American Pizza & Panini

"HighadventurerSingapore, Singapore",Not impressed and here s why !,"Based on below reviews, I thought it s worth a try but upon trying it did not meet my standards benchmarked on Tim Ho Wan HK or the PJ Damansara Jaya dim sim which is packed, all weekend mornings with long queuse.Kai Suan's setting is 1st class being in the lower floor of Pan Pacific (parking is RM5 a hour, compared with RM1.50 next door where you walk across the sky bridge at level 1 adjoining the hotel).Read somewhere the chef is trained by a HK chef and the stuff we had did look the part but did not taste the part. Not sure if lack of pork made the dim sim less cohesive and the har gow or crystal shrimp dumpling did not stick to its skin. Other shortcomings were glutinious rice was too sticky (and did not taste loh mai kai without sausage, mushroom and chicken) > we had porridge which was too thin the chicken feet too tiny and the fish ball really meeny. Mini chicken char siw pau was good but cheong fun was so soOverall the dim sim here did not meet my expectations and likely yours unless you are halal dim sim foodie. No complaint about service but it does take a while for the food to be served. If ever you are to trust any review, first check out the crowd and the queue. Here there is none, big restaurant but only 4 tables were filled on a Saturday ( not sure if this was due to weekend being on Friday). Tea costs Rm2.50 a pax and service tax 10% and govt tax 5%.If you are a discerning dim sim die hard esp the non halal (pork based) this is not what you seek, you may want to go upstairs and have the RM50 per pax international buffet.For those whom don t know what real dim sim taste like,do enjoy your dim sim - you won t know what you are missing.

Order their stir fried intestine, my friends love it. However, i don't really enjoy it, despite its a dish i ordered. Probably it is because i'm very sensitive to porky smell, thus, the intestine have a slight porky smell which is an acquired taste whereby some people love it.

But once you step in, a bright neon sign saying ""bloom"" reassures you that you've found the right place and delights you with rows of dried flowers hanging from the ceiling. Honestly it feels more like a pub than a caf√©, but the subdued neon & warm lights look good to me. The dishes are Japanese fusion, with hefty burgers matched with chilli-flake infused onion chips or earl grey tea-based syrup poured over custard dessert.

"FollowLeeSingapore, Singapore",Not value for money,"Remember that one of your first objectives to go Malaysia JB is to eat cheaper seafood. Right?Well, you are wrong. In fact the seafood around Zon Regency (including Tai Son, nearby seafood hawkers) are overcharging their customers. Tai Son provides you with a menu with good looking photos of their dishes! But take note, when the actual dishes comes out, it does not look like that. No scallops like in the picture, smaller portion, poor quality are all the common problems that we seen when we patronize that place. Waiting time despite only few guests in the restaurant would take about 25mins for your order to arrive. Customer service are very poor and you will not feel welcome by most of the staffs.Also Tai Son's staffs would not allow you to choose where you want to sit to have a better view of the sea. You would most probably get to sit with guests who are drunk and going to get drunk. Take note!One of the Chinese hawker-like restaurant across the road opposite the custom charges small-medium size crab for RM108 (S$43 per kg)!

Nope, not even the popular ones with long queues daily (*hint*) serve a good bowl of my favourite ramen noodles.Service here was kinda 'casual' but the food is a must try.I ordered the pork broth ramen (Shio). The ramen noodles were nicely cooked through but still delightfully chewy. Nice flavourful soup though i'm not sure if it's purely homemade bone broth with dashi or with a mixture of powdered form dashi. My ramen set came with a piece of Onigiri (Triangular rice balls) with preserved plum. That too was good.The grilled mackerel (set) served came with a big piece of mackerel, nicely grilled without being overcooked or dry.One of the favourites here is the spinach salad with browned garlic and crispy bacon. Not a single drop of dressing or seasoning used here but the simple ingredients used complements each other so well.The gyoza tastes good but was a bit too soft.

The ""strawberry"" promotion was just a gimmick and there wasn't a strong strawberry theme other than the use of Pink as a dominant color. The tea they serve is Dilmah and comes in several flavours. When we wanted to refill the pot with water, we found that the self-service hot water dispenser and hot water pot were both empty. It remained empty for a long time as we waited for a service staff to return.

If you have eaten fine omakase, this definitely isn't one.In terms of ambience, I found the restaurant to have a weird odour despite changing seats.The omakase menu ranged from $120/180/200+/300 and 400RM and the difference between the 300 and 400RM is supposedly the portion size.The ingredients are fresh but the chef's execution is poor. Clams were used multiple times, sashimi slices were not equal and generally poor progression of food.The service is genuine and sweet but it feels like the chef is trying too hard.

LTY1986,The worst japanese restaurant,"This place is a fraud. It keeps advertising on facebook that its a high class omakase restaurant, with 2 michelin star chef or under guidance of 2 michelin star chef. Its a lie. Service is at its worst. Waitress knows nothing about the menu or the food served there. They just keep blabbering about the price range of each course, but don't know what's in them. The chef is definitely not a michelin star chef, also definitely not under guidance of michelin star chef too. Counter table is not a proper counter table you see at Omakase restaurant. Food served were horrible that we only ate less than half way through the course we choosed. The last straw was the uni served to us, it was stale/rotten. I have never seen uni that is dark grey in colour. We immediately told them to stop everything. The chef then started arguing with the waitress and his other staffs on whether to charge us for the full course. So I called the waitress out, paid in full, and went off. I just couldn't stand a second more in this shabby place.I have eaten enough of omakase at michelin or non michelin starred restaurants to know that this place is absolutely a fraud.Please guys, close this place down, or stop lying on facebook that you serve michelin starred standard Omakase when in reality, you serve literally rotten food that isn't edible. Your food is so much worse than any other japanese restaurants in JB or any other place in Malaysia. Although others don't claim they are high class omakase or have michelin starred chef, at least they don't serve rotten food.I hope more people see this review and take it seriously, whether you have eaten real omakase before or you haven't, please don't step into this place.People who have eaten proper michelin starred omakase will find this place shockingly disgusting.People who are naive, haven't eaten michelin starred omakase before, if they eat at this place, they would end up having an impression that japanese omakase food taste terrible.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 13 September 2019 ,Kisho Japanese Restaurant

"vetgirl85Johor Bahru, Malaysia",PLEASE CHANGE YOUR MANAGER,"Having been a regular customer since Harvests first opened, I don't feel happy at all to post a bad review but i am extremely disappointed with the current manager George. On more than one occasion I have found George to be dismissive, overbearing and plain RUDE. He is charming on the phone but in person has no intention of listening to or accommodating to his customers. We spent over rm1k for a birthday dinner at Harvests where he was rude and did not assist us to accommodate our full party (despite reservations being made) - instead proceeded to lecture us on covid19 and social distancing. We were fully aware of the SOP before coming to the restaurant. He also tried to clear away our drinks before we had finished before 10pm!And again this evening where i asked to be put on a waiting list for just 2 people at 6pm and he made dismissive 'shoo-ing' hand signals, refused to listen to my request and told me to step aside.I am not at all entitled or expect VIP treatment, but the poor attitude of this manager to regular paying customers is just shocking. We fully understand the SOP regulations during this CMCO but there is no excuse for an f&b manager to have such a poor attitude towards customers. The only reason I would recommended Harvest is for their waitstaff, especially Jing/Josephine who is an absolute superstar and she gave us excellent service during the birthday dinner due to her own initiative and can-do attitude. In the end we decided to go to Yew's cafe just next door - service is very good and prices are better.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 16 May 2020 ,Harvests Bar & Grill

Once we received our food we never had anyone ask us if we needed anything, how it was, if we wanted dessert or refills. After making eye contact with at least 4 different people for about 15 minutes, I finally asked for my check. I really don't know how long they would have let us sit there without coming to talk to us haha. The food was a great value though and my son liked it - I ate the entire pizza so it was definitely delicious!!! I would eat there again given the value for the money and the quality of the food.

They use barbeque sauce as pur√©e. Disgusting. And they put at least 500gms of cheese. I'm not joking. It was rubbery and my kid could only eat a little over 1 slice cause was so heavy.

Where does the meat come from? Don't know...!! By the way, these were the last remaining steaks in a steak house...( of the prime cuts anyway...)So, ok they are not sure of what they're serving, then to order appetizers one soup, one salad and sausages, oppsss sorry no sausages, so it's ok we continue with the selection made for three persons.How would we like the steaks cooked! This is seriously a place which needs a chef and one who knows how to cook! A medium well 300days and rare (blue) Wagu...was ordered.What is delivered are two medium at best best but more to well done for both! The steaks being thin and char grilled to look nice, but cutting the texture and preparation was well off the mark and a complete let down...followed by the fact there were no more steaks available...leads to one dish returned and a new order made from the restaurant menu...which us like the roulette wheel as many are simply not available.If you want wine with your beef, please do come with the mindset for Shiraz, yes this fruity little number is the only wine available in the whole wine bar list...all of the others are not available.I dont know if this place is closing down, or in a change of management but really with the alternatives available in Johor I won't be coming back here even if you paid me too!Show less",1.0,Reviewed 9 July 2016 ,The Brazzo House

Prices for pasta start from under 20RM with decent sized, tasty portions.Personally, I had the seared ahi-tuna - although I was in two minds given that, at 58 RM, it was significantly more expensive than most other menu items. However, it was perfectly cooked, and coated with sesame seeds, served on some delicious sauce with asparagus (still with the right amount of crunch) and some orangey coloured mash (not sure if it was cheesy, or sweet potato). I would have been as happy with a smaller portion for a smaller price, but it was fantastic, and well worth the money.Braised lamb meat fell perfectly from the bone. German sausages and mash brought back memories of the Greenwich in Brussels; mmm!Atmosphere is quite modern, but still cosy. Staff and service were both excellent.

However, they refused to change the other two for us because WE HAVE TASTED THE COCONUT. (Can I ask a question, how can you scoop the flesh without drinking the juice?)

So, be careful when you ordered the coconut, it may be rejected coconuts from the previous customers. They even ask me to go into their kitchen to pick my own YOUNG coconut, so that CUSTOMER NEED TO BEAR THEIR OWN RISK! Meaning if you were to order Coconut in Carabao, you need to be professional in picking coconut to avoid getting a OLD HARD coconut.LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, they even ask me whether AM I A SINGAPOREAN? I think this should not be a question to be asked. So what if I am a Singaporean and so what if I am not????

We went to the same college, studied in the same foundation program before he went his separate way to Wellington while I on the other hand, headed to Dunedin in New Zealand. We still keep in touch even after we graduated - he went back to his hometown in JB to kick-start his career and worked his way up the industry. He is now certified auditor with his own firm. No matter how busy he is, he will try to make some time to entertain me whenever I'm in town, as long as he's around. So this restaurant is a family friend of his, and now he's handling their accounts. We just blindly followed him into the restaurant and he ordered some of the dishes for us, with a bottle of Cordon Bleu to keep us entertained while waiting. ‚óæSteamed fish - embarrassed to say this but I'd forgotten the type of fish but what I remember was that the fish was very fresh and steamed to perfection. ‚óæDeep fried chicken leg - by far my favourite dish of the night.

Herman3684,Seafood birthday dinner,"Went on a seafood dinner at New Lucky Seafood on 17th Nov 2019 after some recommendation online. On reaching the restaurant, there was no menu and we had no idea how much we were paying for our food. Henceforth, to play safe, we ordered bee hoon crabs, pig stomach soup and a prawn paste dish. I asked for a small bowl of soup and the server said they only have 1 size at 10 ringit. Thinking that just 3 simple dishes won't burn our pocket, we proceeded to wait for our food.20mins later, our food came along. The bee hoon was very salty, crabs were normal with no wow factor.However, we didn ask for 2 crabs as it was just the 2 of us yet 2 crabs came along and I wonder if the server considered that it was too much for us. Next came the prawn paste which was cold and not crispy at all. Lastly came the soup, also normal and no wow factor except for the price that really ""wowed"" me. From a mere 10 ringit as mentioned as by server, it snowballed to 70 ringit for a ingredientless white pepper soup with just some mushrooms and pig stomach. It really made me wonder if this restaurant is a black shop without giving a clear pricelist and based the price based on instruction from their kitchen upon my enquiry.Look at the receipt attached and you will know what I mean. And point to note, we just had peanuts and no crackers issued to us as they claimed that there was only 2 of us instead of 4. However, we paid for cost of peanuts cum crackers yet they took the crackers out based on their own business aspect.I strongly discourage going to New lucky restaurant.

"jorc23Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Worst experience ever,"Dear friends, Please DO NOT VISIT THIS restaurant!!!It‚Äôs operated by Vietnamese but the food that they cook is nothing similar to what is cooked in Vietnam. Please share and viral it!!The incident starts like this, I looked for Vietnam food in Johor and found this on trip advisor, when I arrived there was no customer in the restaurant, I thought maybe it‚Äôs a bit late as I arrived around 9pm.When I was ordering my food, there‚Äôs a lot of choice not available so I assume that they‚Äôre about to close therefore not much choice, so I ordered 1x Kangkung, 1x fish, 1x pho noodle, 1x chicken rice, 1x prawn, 1x soup and drinks. So the staff told me that the fish will need 30minute to cook. I said fine. Here the problem comes, 30minutes, not even a single item was presented to our table, so I wave at the staff, he saw and ignored me and continue talking with another tables guest. The first thing to come is the chicken rice. You can refer to photo. For those who eat Vietnam food, know that this is not how it supposed to be. I have no issues with their pho noodle and prawn, but came the vegetable, and soup which was very disappointing. Look in the photo, does it look appetitive to you? Is this how Kangkung is cooked? I ignored it and thought just eat and leave. But there‚Äôs more. The soup is worst, I‚Äôve eaten fish since I was young, how can I not tell if the fish is edible or not. The soup does not taste anything near to what there is in Vietnam. So I asked the staff to take the soup and return it to the kitchen, and told him there mud smell with the fish and it spoils the soups which makes it taste aweful. He brought it back to the kitchen and then bring back the exact bowl of soup to me again. I told him I don‚Äôt want it, he just ignored me.Lastly the steam fish arrived, I just took 1 bite and obviously know that the fish was not clean properly, you can see a lot scales on the fish and taste has an odour. I told him I don‚Äôt want this fish, he act as if he didn‚Äôt understand me. After that, I told my girlfriend to speak to him in Vietnamese, which is his mother tongue language, he heard everything and DID NOTHING. So I wrote a review on their page, and message their page about the food, the message was read but there‚Äôs no courtesy to reply. You can refer to the photo. Then we found out the girl who is the manager of the restaurant, she came in right after I complain on Facebook but did not even came to us to find out the issue. We know she is the one who manages the Facebook and replies. I was so mad and frustrated with someone with this type of attitude opening restaurant who doesn‚Äôt know how to manage. So I went in and wanted to pay, when she show me the bill, I told the manager I didn‚Äôt eat the soup and fish, because it‚Äôs inedible, she refuse to take out the fish from my bill, so I demand her to try the dishes herself, the food is as per in the photo and we didn‚Äôt touch further. I personally went to my table and took the dishes to the counter and ask her to try. To my surprise, she said ‚ÄúNOTHING WRONG WITH IT‚Äù Me and my girlfriend argued with the manager, as I was speaking English to her, she seems not understand enough, so I ask my girlfriend talk to her instead but she just keep giving reasons, and say I cannot eat and don‚Äôt pay, at that moment, I already put cash on the counter. The bill is RM111.20 and I put RM112 at the counter. It got me so furious I really wish the authorities would do something about this place.

Nevertheless, we could still enjoy the view. I believed we saw some parts of Singapore & the Straits of Johor.My partner & I ended up ordering the Alaskan Pollock king crab of course & since the king crab was huge, we ordered just another dish of buttered prawns as we were worried that we won‚Äôt be able to finish the 2 dishes.

saharudinmariam8558,Selera Senibong Seafood or SSS - The biggest and the most popular Muslim seafood,"Johor Bahru is famous for its variety of foods available for all races, including seafood which is one of the major attractions in JB. No matter what you do in JB you will have to find food. The Selera Senibong Seafood or SSS is located at No. 1 Persisiran Pantai Senibong, Permas Jaya. It is a huge seafood restaurant complex anywhere in Johor or probably in Malaysia which can seat more than 1,500 persons any time. There are several operators within this complex and your experience will depend on which particular operator you came into contact with.After all, taste is a very subjective matter and not all people have the same opinion on the same thing. Having said that, our experience having dinner at SSS with 50 others in the whole family was excellent. The big siakap fish cooked with 3 rasa specialty recipe was just so tasty, fried squid, prawn etc are well prepared. For this huge number of people having food at the same time, the service was quite fast.All this while, we have been going to Singgah Selalu and Selera Johor to taste the best of Johor recipe but SSS is probably one of the best in the biggest complex of seafood which is hala for Muslims. We simply love this place. If you are coming by car, parking could be a bit of a problem during peak hours.There is no visible sign board for this place. However, ask any Johoreans in JB about this place, they would probably know the location or any taxi driver, which we did. If you are driving from hotels located along Jalan Dato' Sulaiman vicinity, just turn left heading towards north along Jalan Tebrau, look for direction Permas Jaya and turn right at traffic light with Public Bank on the right as the land mark, drive straight until the flyover, passing through the underneath and further up until you see AEON supermarket as the landmark but turn right at the traffic light and straight up until you meet a T junction, turn left and straight on, you will see a big signboard on Chinese Seafood Restaurant, but this is not the one, passing through a little bit more and then turn right and you are there.At night the restaurant is not visible from the main road which is under construction but use waze navigator and it will bring you there and it is worth the trouble. Remember taste is subjective and ask guidance from your friends who have been there to get the right operator. In general, all operators are good but there may be others who are exceptionally good than the rest based on the experiences of others who have been there. It is a well recommended place to go if you like to search for new and interesting place to eat. Remember, they are only open in the evening.

All items were billed according to the listed price in menu EXCEPT for the fried squid. The listed price in the menu was RM28 but we were billed RM51.60.

And when I asked further how come I ordered from the fixed price menu but was billed according to weight instead? They kept silent. And the price of squid according to their price list of seafood was only RM70 per kg. Avoid going there and getting ripped off!

Item worth trying are the Chee Cheong Fun, and the Char Shao Siew. The Chee Cheong Fun is smooth and comes with an adequate amount of Char Siew. The Char Shao Siew also has a nice crust to it. The Char Siew is okay though, and lacks the charred flavour.The items not worth getting are the egg tarts and the century egg porridge. The egg tart is rather small with a thick crust and lacks the custard. The century egg porridge isn‚Äôt very flavourful and rather watery. Show less",3.0,Reviewed 17 December 2019 ,Tasixi Restaurant

travelwittkids,Decent dim sum ,"Have only been here twice, both on Sundays. Caters better for large groups because they have a queueing system, albeit only one hostess to seat you, and they arrange the tables for you based on the number of your pax. However this contributes to the wait especially when some patrons cut queue and hog tables that weren't cleaned properly yet. Be patient and let the hostess settle your seating for you. There is an air conditioned area in the middle while the rest is open air. Tables get only one wipedown between customers so you might want to do another wipedown for yourself and your kids.Try their wantan mee (the noodles they used are a bit different), chee cheong fan (prawn), steamed pork ribs, xiao long bao (let it cool a bit before letting the kids try it), charsiu bao. The dimsum in general is okay. In some servings, you might find the flavour a bit lacking and inconsistent (tastes nice one time, taste different another). It's dimsum roulette basically.You can refill hot water for your tea yourself. They have hot water dispensers here and there. They also make drinks to order as well. You have to pay at the counter. I don't see any cashless options available so have some cash on you before you visit. Price-wise it isn't considered expensive for dim sum. There is ample parking behind, you may need to walk a bit. If you park at the back, you can take the exit at the back of the restaurant though understandably that path is dirtier than going the long way around.Parking up front is trickier. The parking lots are drawn smaller than usual (someone messed up) so patrons usually park a little bit outside of their boxes to keep some space in between the cars in front and at the back (otherwise your car can't really get out when you want to leave). As a result, expect drivers to double park and block the exit of parked cars. And a lot of honking. And sometimes arguments. It is a stressful situation. Maybe you should not go on Sundays. #justathought Based on their FB page, their off days are on Wednesdays. It also says they're open from 6.30am to 4pm.

The AEON mall was half an hour before closing and we were so desperate to find place to eat and fortunately this restaurant still accommodated us.They serve Thai cuisine and its Halal. We ordered the Tom Yum Soup (which was very delicious and very rich in flavor), Thai fish cake (which tastes not bad also), Seafood Omellette (which was very nice and abit crispy on the side) and the Pineapple fried rice (which was nice but then too soggy). Sadly they don't have anymore the Thai milk tea that time so we gave a try of their black canyon coffee with milk which we really liked the taste and fragrance of the coffee.

Texture was a wee bit tough but they were deep fried. Sauce was sweet sour and had lots of umami. 7.75/10. Kam hiong lala - the clams were so so fresh and clean. No grit at all. Kam hiong was one of the best I've ever had. Great interpretation of such a varied yet common flavouring in Malaysian Chinese cooking. Great mix of aromatics, texture producing hair bee and lard, with tangy Assam based sauce base to bring the flavours together. And enough umami to satisfy even Godzilla. 9.5/10Dongpuo Pork belly was good. But the meat could have been more tender. Mantou (rice flour bun) was soft and fresh but could have been fluffier. Credible effort and very good interpretation of the dish. 7.5/10Garlic fried Hong Kong kai lan with scallops. Excellent. Veggies were not overcooked and were done just right. Great texture. Scallops very good but could have used a bit more sear. 8.5/10Restaurant decorations seemed like they came out of a late 80s early 90s Hong Kong gangster movie. Or an intergalactic crime lord like Jabba the Hutt. A runway/catwalk intersects the big main dining hall. Black painted walls create a dark and mysterious interior while the hanging chandeliers and gold and silver motifs give the impression that a very successful Chinese underworld figure was behind the entire operation and his offices were upstairs.

"DeviousDragoHiiJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Staffs are really polite,Was there yesterday and the atmosphere was very much like their signature soundboard Fifty Trees. Lotsa plants.But the setback was the aircon was really bad so they actually use a lot of fan standing ones. But maybe some of the aircon was off or under repair. Food overall is good n very reasonable price. Not expensive $$. N was big potion. Their design has change since I last visited last time their inner greenhouse was nicer but now it's just full of plants. I will visit there again even the aircon is colder. Using fan is stuffy. Had a fried kuey tiaw and white meehoon n waffles with ice cream. The setback was the samba which is really not up to my expectation. Overall I will give 2 stars for the aircon n usage of fan all over and white mee hoon is average unless u have great sambal.

The ambience was relaxful with P Ramlee films being played on TV as background.We ordered 2 dulang sets (lemak daging and patin tempoyak). Each of the set consisted another 2 fried dish of our choices (chicken, catfish etc), supplemented with ulam (salads), flavoured sauce of our choices (belacan, budu, cincalok) and 2 of rice. Each dulang costed us RM25 (for 2 pax).We added fried Tempe and scrambled eggs and altogether with 4 drinks we were charged about RM94. We were not disappointed as the taste was above our expectation and beyond our satisfaction and it was so delicious it worth every cents we spent.The service was pretty quick as opposed to majority of the reviews here saying it was too slow. Maybe luck was on our side.We paid using Maybank QR Pay and it was hassle free. Did I tell you the premise was spotless clean? Yes it was, impressively!

The chicken-parmesan-something was served with tomato sauce, I who like sour food savor the taste. Normal chicken chop on the other hand was just so-so as the chicken have a bland taste.As for service and the restaurant it self, the service was good.

My husband ordered the Supreme and thoroughly enjoyed his meal! Quite disappointed to see no kids' meals in their menu, it being a family restaurant. No kid could finish that sized portion, considering that a plate of pasta is huge for even adult consumption.Ambiance was nice but it got rather noisy with the background music and the echos from fellow patrons trying to outdo talking to each other. Though they offer free wifi, it was almost non existent. Food servicing was ok though we were served soup for a local fare, AFTER the meal was completed because staff 'forgot' about it. Staff was not very proactive. My friend's son spilled drinks on the table and dripped onto the floor and NO staff came forth to assist clear the mess. At most, they gave us a handful of serviettes to deal with the mess ourselves.Washroom is inconveniently located at the lower floor so have to get down a flight of stairs.

shopaholickkworld,Not worth,"Reading some of the reviews here makes me even question if I ate at the same restaurant as them LOL. Ate sum sum here with my family for brunch over the weekend. The food was passable. Dim sum is my dad's favorite food, so he has high standards and we were sorely disappointed after reading reviews here from another site. The dim sum skins were all hard and dry. They don't seem to Be freshly made from the kitchen. Some of the fillings I quite liked, but the skin is half the meal right? The pei dan porridge was average, as was the paper wrapped chicken that lacked flavor. We also ordered a plate of kailan from the regular menu, and it was better than the dim sum, but still overcooked. The most awful thing that happened out of all this was the salted egg fish skin (put on our table without us asking for it - but we thought eh, why not). Not only was the flavor less than adequate, the whole bowl was stale to the point where it was inedible. At the end of the meal, with the bowl still full, we complained about its quality. But before my dad could finish his sentence, the manager finished it for him that it was stale. Sooo they fully knew about this but still dared serve it to us?!Service was also deplorable. When seated, staff came with piles and piles of food, quickly plopped on our table like hoping to get rid of the stuff, or make us get things we don't even eat? 90% of the staff were not Chinese, did not speak Chinese, and didn't understand ""chili oil"" (which as a dim sum restaurant they did not have). Then there was the Filipino waitress who kept telling us repeatedly which baskets has pork in them, not serving us the ones that did, till the point which my dad had to tell her we weren't Muslim. Wtf? The staff who did speak Chinese were nonchalant and her actions speak like she was unwilling to help us get food. The only staff that knew anything about anything and could ""problem solve"" was the very busy manager. Must be tough on her. Ambience wise is more promising than the foood. Air-conditioning, table cloth and typical 90s Chinese restaurant setting. Toilet did not have toilet paper.For a place like this and food quality, they charge way too much.

"jalanjalanmasakmasakSingapore, Singapore",I can EAT - PLAY - LAUGH in Johore Bahru!,"Spending a rainy weekend with two great friends and their 3 wonderfully cuddly labradors, was my idea to get away from Singapore, to chow down to some authentic tastes in Malaysia. I knew I could always count on my buds to bring me to the best of the best - and that counts for other places in the world too.Jump a few years back, when I came to Singapore on holiday; I was their houseguest when they had a gorgeous black and white house in Singapore. The lady of the house prepared me a very simple but outstanding meal straight from the recipe book of her mother-in-law who was Peranakan and that dish stayed planted in my mind ever since. Yes, I have cooked it too, but I daresay, that nothing beats the whole cooking process, with a glass of wine in hand, prepping ingredients and cooking to juicy gossip and raucous laughter. Nyonya food goes well with relationships and most of all, lasting friendships.Back to this night in Johor, my hosts brought me to a sixties house somewhere in a basement and as it turns out, I knew the owner, from a long time ago back in Singapore. The place is simple and their menu had a selection of Chinese, Peranakan, Arab, Italian and French - even my native Filipino, was represented. My friend said - your dish is here. Without any hesitation, we ordered a whole mess of Nyonya & Javanese. Like we all haven‚Äôt had a meal in days.Everything was cooked fresh, so there is a slight wait. I can excuse that because there were other yummy things to munch on, like their melinjo nut and their large ikan bilis with nuts. I don‚Äôt know what was in it, but the fish were bigger than usual, but fried to perfection. And washed down by good beer.The dish I had been craving was the Udang Masak Lemak Nenas or Pineapple Prawn in Spicy Coconut Milk Gravy, and it was divine - the owner is also Baba‚Ä¶.but then, everything we ordered was delectable. The prawns were huge and fresh, with the right amount of tart and sour, with the pineapple broth on plain white rice. I was in bliss and savoured each and every mouthtful. My hosts were laughing at me, swooning in between spoonfuls of broth.We also ordered a Gado Gado to share, which my friend said is served differently at EPL - the sauce is barely there. I was going to ask for more sauce, but my friend said to try it first. Just to try, I took a bite - the flavours were so full bodied, more sauce would have been a pity. I was told this is the Javanese style of Gado Gado, less on sauce but huge on flavour.Torta - which is a smoked then smashed whole eggplant, pan fried with a beaten egg, is a simple Filipino dish - it tasted like my father‚Äôs torta, but I twisted it a bit with the EPL homemade sambal belacan.Dessert came in the form of the thinnest nut brittles with pumpkin seeds, sesame, peanuts and cashews - it was so good, we all had to buy a jar to bring back home. I also loved the achar - again, Nyonya style and super yummy. The chef said it was his last bottle. I spoke to the owner and said it was the best achar I‚Äôve had in years! This last jar quickly found it way inside my backpack.If you do find yourself crossing the Tuas causeway, and are fed up with the usual stalls and malls, do check out EPL Place, this won‚Äôt bust your wallet either - eat a lot, and laugh a lot, - the food is definitely not ‚Äòplay play‚Äô food - it‚Äôs seriously delicious and worth the trip!Show less",5.0,Reviewed 11 July 2016 ,"EPL (Eat, Play, Laugh)"

The chicken is served piping hot and juicily tender (fried just before serving) and the accompanying gravy is delicious. The rice comes with small servings of ikan masin, tempeh, rendang kelapa and stir-fried longbeans. Service is abrupt, and self-serve. Approach the counter, yell your order to the indifferent staff, catch a plate as it appears on the ""service counter"", find a seat somewhere in the food court and chow down.

I had come here about 10 years ago, had a great lunch with my customer and vowed to come back here again. A decade has passed and if not for my friend, I'd never rediscover this restaurant. As the name suggest, the specialty is fish.. but oddly it was not steam fish but fried fish that took the centerstage. We will get to that later. Located in between Taman Sentosa and Taman Pelangi, coming here during peak hours and you might have to wait for table. Spacious and airy, you won't feel stuffy or hot. ‚óæFried fish - using red snapper, they de-boned and cut the fish in their own way before coated in light batter and deep fried. If not for the tail of the fish, you would not be able to tell what it is. Just cut off the chunks of meat and savour the fresh, sweet and tender fish which was sweet and savoury as they use combination of Thai sweet chilly sauce, dark soy sauce, mayonnaise and spring onion. Marvellous! ‚óæStir fried shark lip - do look out for available fresh seafood in the chiller. My friend spotted the last plate of this collagen goodness stuff and proceed to order it. They stir fried it and served.. I walloped most of it. ‚óæStuffed ma yao fish - the tedious process of de-boning the fish, minced the meat and then stuffed back the meat before deep fried. Love it but still overshadowed by the fried fish. ‚óæDong po yuk - served in their own sauce which was not too thick (like those we get in Klang Valley) together with beancurd skin, it didn't feel too heavy to go with our meal.

Seriously I thought all their mother's must have died that morning.The menu was lacking and needed some explanation but good luck getting friendly advice out of this lot.In a word they were pathetic at their jobs.The food was better than average.

"Kristinah87Johor Bahru, Malaysia",The worst Indian restaurant that I have ever visited,"This incident happened in December last year. The reason I have decided to share this incident now is to spread the awareness to the customers. Before this incident happened, I do visit this restaurant quite often with my friends during lunch hour and after work. I won't check my bills at all and will just pay the amout that is stated. Till the day of the incident.On the day of the incident, me and my friends went there for dinner after work. We ordered 3 tea, 1 ginger tea, 1 tosai and 1 chicken kotthu parotha. When we wanted to pay, we asked for the bil and the waiter brought the bill to us. They billed us with 4 tea and a different amount of the kotthu parotha. In the menu, it was stated that the chicken kotthu parotha is RM7.00 but they charged us RM8.00. We told the waiter about the differences, so he took the bill back and minus off the price for 1 tea which we didnt ordered. Then he gave the bill back to us. We asked him about the differences in the kotthu parotha price, he said we have to pay the amount that is stated in the bill because thats the correct amount in the system. When we mention that the menu stated a different price, they argue and said no, its RM8.00 so we requested them to bring the menu to us again to double confirm. In the end, the price that was stated on the menu is RM7.00. When we asked about it again, the waiter called the manager in charge instead. The manager in charge was quite rude to us. He said that we have to pay for the price that is stated in the system and the menu is an old menu plus he said that the price for chicken and mutton item in their shop is the same. I am a frequent customer there and I know that the menu is quite new as they just changed it recently. At that point, we know that there is no point arguing with them, so, we paid for the amount and left the restaurant and never went back there again. The issue here is not because of the few ringgits, its the trust that customer had towards the restaurant. We ordered the food believing that the price that we will be paying later is as stated in the menu but their system will print out a different amount and us being people who are generous will just pay the amount without even checking the bill. Imagine how many ""error"" amount or the number of your ordered item can be add on to the bill? The way the manager in charge handled the situation was quite bad as well. They don't care whether you are a frequent customer or no, they just don't respect you. Their concept is, you have to pay the amout that is stated in the receipt, doesnt matter if its not the same as you see in the menu.I will never go back to this restaurant again. Visitors, please be careful when you want to eat here. Check your bills before you pay.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 24 March 2016 ,Amma Restaurant

"Vincent MNew Orleans, Louisiana",Very Impressive New Caf√©,"We were delighted to discover August Caf√© on our last day in Johor Bahru. We had just walked round the Sultan‚Äôs palace, and worked up a considerable thirst on a sweltering hot day. We headed toward the Pasar Karat area thinking surely we could find someplace there to recuperate a bit. By great good fortune we turned onto Jalan Tan Hiok Nee from Jalan Bukit Timbalan and presto, there it was, right on the corner. The August Caf√© just opened recently, and I can believe that. (On Google maps, if you zoom in on that intersection you‚Äôll see it stilled labeled as ‚ÄúPetals & Twigs‚Äù‚Äîpresumably the shop that used to be at that location‚Äîbut if you click on the name, up pops a photo of August Caf√©, labeled as such. It‚Äôs at the extreme western end of the jalan, on the south side, as now shown on TripAdvisor.) They have outdoor tables, but we opted to chill out inside, where it was much cooler. The interior d√©cor is stylish but easy-going, and we chilled out to mellow jazz, including Casablanca‚Äôs As Time Goes By (I would have asked whoever was controlling the music to play it again, but I doubt his name was Sam). August Caf√© serves quite a variety of hot coffee drinks, hot teas, cold drinks, and frozen drinks, none of them alcoholic. Ratchanok opted for a long black, and I was going to go with their lemongrass-ginger tea, when I discovered that they‚Äôve also got four different flavours of Australian craft soda. I love Bundebergs but haven‚Äôt encountered any in almost six months, so I switched my order to a lemon/lime/bitters and Ratchanok got a passionfruit soda. (Incidentally, the Bundies aren‚Äôt on the menu yet, since they‚Äôve just started carrying them.) We also had some of their banana-walnut cake, which was fabulous. Their other pastries included carrot cheesecake, red velvet cake, and ‚Äúchocolate devil cake.‚Äù They serve some creative international mains (steak sandwich on panini, pink salmon with rocket and a caramel sauce, quail pasta, chicken quesadilla, etc., price range RM15 to RM28), as well as a few sides but we didn‚Äôt order any, so I can‚Äôt comment on quality. Some other TA reviewer‚Äôs going to have to chime in on the mains and sides. Nor do I know whether the menu is constant or changing.

Such a unique dish and it tastes good; the fresh beans are crisp with a tinge of sweetness from the tea leaves. Would definitely go back for this dish again. The served appetiser (you do need to pay for them) is the beans and guava. We rejected the beans because we don't take them but I enjoyed the guava though the ones in Thailand are definitely better. The vegetable dishes were generally yummy. We ordered the Brinjal and the Fried Yam, both of which tasted good. The noodle soup is also delicious because the soup is rich and the noodle's texture is just right. Same goes for our lotus peanut pork rib soup which also tastes yummy, though I'm pretty sure my mum, who's a very good cook, can also do the same. The only dish that we didn't enjoy is the drunken chicken - we didn't enjoy the flavour of the seasoning/marination as we find the taste of the wine overpowering. Oh yes, the sour plum drink wasn't to my liking as well but the rest of my companions enjoyed it. Should try the honey green tea the next time round. Though I've read reviews of the bad service, we personally enjoyed quite good service there.

It felt more like a practice session, as the female singer gave us the impression that she trying out singing different songs. 2) Food wise, I ordered their Signature ""flaming-ribeye"" (picture attached) and had requested it to be done ""medium-well"". When my steak came, I remarked to my friends that the beef was overtly tough and over-cooked; as I had difficulties cutting into my steak. I later found out that their cook had cooked a thick piece of string (which is supposed to help keep steaks in their medallion shape) with the beef... As a result, I had been trying to cut the string along with the beef!The staff which served us, as well as the manager of the place, repeatedly offered their apologies and even gave me a complimentary half pint of beer as a token of good-will. I was rather satisfied with their level of enthusiasm and would like to commend the staff and management for a good piece of service recovery.Perhaps, it was a case of a new restaurant still struggling with teething operational issues, but I have no doubt that they will be able to iron these problems out in the months to come.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 5 June 2015 ,Brunch2Wine

We ordered the sashimi lobster, fresh oysters, pineapple and crab meat fried rice, and chili and steamed crabs with mantous (mini toasted buns). The sashimi lobster was fresh and firm, and the shells made the accompanying soup sweeter when put into the boiling soup. However, don't understand why is it that when I asked for more sashimi soy sauce, the waiter refused to give me more despite all of us finishing our respective sauce dish. Parents loved the oysters, and we really enjoyed the sweetness of the pineapple fried rice and how the crab meat in the crab meat fried rice was genuine and not the crab stick kind like we thought.

"nhidayahmSingapore, Singapore",Average customer service but delicious snacks.,"We made a stopover to try out this quaint cafe after a Malaysian friend recommended it for our foodie trip. Banana fritters have always been one of my favourite tea time snacks and this place made something traditional into something more modern and interesting. It was really a great idea to have this before our big meal. Work up the palate a little bit more. Served hot fresh from the fryer...crispy and just about the right taste of sweetness. We chose the ones with caramel and chocolates with cheese. Drink it with your coffee or tea...the taste balances just well with them. I also ordered a mango ice blended. Refreshing with a tinge of sourness that helps to perk your palate up. Some friends thought that the prices are slightly on the higher side but personally, i think it is still reasonable if you share it amongst friends. Highly recommended this place if you take a trip down to JB.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 30 August 2016 ,Pisang
"amewscuriosityJohor Bahru, Malaysia",When traditional goreng pisang (banana fritters) turns into fusion!,"Love the ambience of modern yet roomy space, chillax music in the background whilst enjoying my fusion banana fritters! Banana fritters menu served: Cornflake Choc (RM8.00) Peanut Butter Choc (RM8.00) Ice Cream Nut (RM8.00) Caramel (RM8.00) Choc Nut Ball (RM7.00) Choc cheese (RM7.00) Cheese (RM6.00) Original (RM5.00) I picked the mini combo where you can choose up to 4 flavors. My pick was Choc Cheese, Ice Cream Nut, Choc Nut Ball, & Cornflake Choc where Choc Cheese is my favorite! The banana fritters are coated with breadcrumbs and fried unlike traditional one where its flour coated. This is simply delicious and what matters most it's not too oily!!! What's not to love, eh?As for Cornflake Choc and Choc Nut Ball, I believe or so I asume, the banana is boiled beforehand. The banana texture is quite different from fried - breadcrumb coated fritters. It's soft and tender inside instead of those crispy fritters! Ain't like eating it monogamously. But the chocolate syrup was way too sweet for my tastebud, because IMHO the boiled banana is already sweet and add up the sweetness of chocolate syrup, sweetness levels goes off chart! Not recommended for diabetic consumer. Hence my preference wighted more to the grated chocolate on Choc Cheese. Ice Cream Nut is my second favorite. I'd be happier if it was vanilla or chocolate flavored ice cream on top of those crispy fritters! I'd be sold at the first ngap(bite).But, for those who stick with traditional way, fret not. For the original/authenticity is preserved. Clasically served with sambal kicap, authentic Johorean style (the best way ever for me, well sue me I'm Johorean through and through) :PThere are also some local dish served such as nasi lemak, fried rice and noodles. Some great selection for coffee served hot/cold. It's the matter of preference. The toilet is clean, keep it that way! Pricewise: mid-range.Overall, I'd say thumbsup for giving us variety ways of eating banana fritters. Who would've thought the traditional banana fritters can turns fusion back in yesteryears? This is where Mom said it is vastly different when one would get the goreng pisang at warung(stall) in the good old days. Monogamous? It's the matter of preference. Your pick (; Postscript: I'll be back to try the caramel one and all cheese. That's all about banana! Give it a try.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 7 April 2016 ,Pisang

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",A nice place for drinks,"This lounge is in the KSL Hotel end of KSL Mall. KSL Hotel markets itself as a 5-star establishment. The lounge reflects that. It's large, yet the tables have been arranged to offer privacy, helped no doubt by the dim lighting. Carpeted floors, comfortable low chairs, nice music...cozy for couples then. There is a pool table at one end. The staff have always been very professional and polite when I've visited. The food menu is a mix of Asian and Western. Choices are somewhat limited, but you can actually request dishes that are not on the menu. I was told that the chef in one of KSL's restaurants (Infusion Cafe?) prepares the items that are not on the menu. The wait staff will have to ask first though, so be prepared for delays. I like their nasi lemak, while the butter prawns (not on the menu) is very good. I'm normally there for the beer, and it's all good on that front. They also have a wide selection of cocktails, but overall, the choice of alcoholic drinks could be better. The prices are reasonable for a 5-star establishment (whether KSL is indeed 5-star worthy is another issue altogether). Strangely, the lounge is nearly always empty. People seem to go there to drink, and only drink. Perhaps it's because there are plenty of famous cafes located close to the lounge, serving a wider variety of food, at cheaper prices. Or maybe because it's too dark to entertain guests and family, or greet visitors, as is the norm in most hotel lounges. Thus reducing the lounge into a watering hole. A nice place to drink, and perhaps do other things, surreptitiously (like I said, it's dark with some cleverly hidden tables). Show less",4.0,Reviewed 6 June 2015 ,Twilight Bar & Lounge

A friend and I visited for a late night dinner and drinks. They forgot my vegetarian sandwich. When reminded them a fair while after my friend had been served her dinner of satay chicken kebabs and I had been nibbling on her blocks of pressed rice, it quickly arrived and I barely touched it as it was very bland and not very nice - it was obviously made in a hurry.Visit 2. A group of us went for dinner. I decided to choose the vegetarian curry this time. Once again it was sub-standard and I barely touched it. The others enjoyed their food except for the chicken kebabs - the first lot were lovely with a delicious satay sauce and blocks of pressed rice, but the second lot left a lot to be desired with both the quality of the cooking and of the chicken, and the majority were left on the table.Visit 3. My boyfriend and I got take away chicken kebabs and while waiting had a couple of long island iced teas - the drinks were lovely, although they were 32 ringgit each! The kebabs were fine on this occasion.Over the three visits we came to the conclusion that the food is not consistent and the vegetarian food is definitely not up to standard.

Sad to announce that upon arriving, we realized that Old Town coffee only opens at 9am. Fine, we'll wait till then. An hour is still ample time for a good breakfast.We walked around at was literally waiting at the counter at 9am, and the Malay cashier just told us to wait, they're not ready, before strolling over to their side door to get a line for queuing. At 9.05am, we asked if we could at least have a paper menu to look at (as the cashier has yet to turn on their electronic menu). She finally passed one to us and we tried to make our orders at 9.10am. The same cashier told us to wait again, as the cash register system was not ready. At 9.15am we couldn't wait any longer and asked if we could just order and pay in advance and get our order items within the next 10 minutes. The cashier told me that all menu items were ready to be served immediately since it's already 9.15am. When I finally ordered the items on a piece of paper (cash register STILL WASN'T UP), the kitchen staff said the item I ordered needed at least 15 minutes of cooking. I walked away, having waited 40 minutes for nothing.Thank God we already ordered some delicious noodles and drinks from the eager and hardworking Indian store right next to Old Town Cafe. Their food was served to us in less than 5 minutes.We were also extremely thankful to have found another cafe restaurant on the other end of the harbor called Mana cafe.

Today, instead of meals of all kind of Western and local cuisine, this restaurant offers seafood and Chinese dishes. Generally, the food served are quite tasty and nice. The service here is good and the crowd here (unlike most Chinese restaurant) was not so overwhelming that it became impossible for us to have a descent conversation over dinner. I have dined in many Chinese restaurants and this restaurant rates good and the environment was pretty cool.In terms of pricing, I have not ordered crab and therefore I cannot comment on this, but for fish, calamari, venison, large prawns etc. it was not bad. It is not cheap, but affordable and I would rate it as being moderate as compared to most Chinese restaurant of its class.Conclusion? This restaurant is worth visiting whilst you are in town. It is not fancy and the food is not extremely good; but the pricing is OK, although not the cheapest.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 6 June 2016 ,Marina Seafood Restaurant

"ceemohanJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Good!,"Been eating here for ages, when it was previously known as ""Jaws"" and then ""Straits View"". This was one of the default restaurants for our family functions-birthdays, anniversaries, etc. It's also halal, making it easy for lunches with the staff. I've always been surprised at the number of Indian restaurants in TA's list of Top Ten restaurants in JB. The Grand Gem, for one, certainly doesn't deserve to be there. Where are the Chinese restaurants, I used to wonder. After all, JB is probably best know for it's Malaysian-Chinese seafood cuisine. My theories? Indian restaurants are frequented by English speaking folks who have the time, and certainly inclination, to write a review. And they tend to err on the side of caution. Chinese restaurants are frequented by folks who are probably not well versed in English, are probably cynical, and have no time to write a review. Call me a bigot then. Anyway, this means that plenty of lovely Chinese seafood restaurants are overlooked. Or perhaps, that's the idea. To prevent escalating prices and dropping standards...Anyway, this restaurant has large seating areas which are clean and comfortable. It serves pretty good Chinese seafood dishes, with a good selection of alcoholic drinks. We particularly enjoy their roast chicken and prawn dishes. They also have enough vegetarian dishes to keep our ""vege"" family members happy. It has, however, become expensive. Recently, the restaurant has started catering to large tour groups, but that has not ruined our dining experience so far.

So we specially drove over, valet parked at the opposite Doubletree Hotel, went in..but left within 5 minutes, looking disappointed.

And none were impressed nor attracted with the 2nd floor rooftop view or wow factor of it. Drinks wise, no comment as we didn't stay on to drink. But for the atmosphere and environment, suggest Mad160 could add more punch and energy to liven up the place (make it less boring, more attractive), and leverage more towards alfresco/open sky/balcony concept instead of rooftop.

We were served with 5 types of cold appetizers. We selected beef ribeye steak, Marinated pork, Spicy Pork belly, and Beef Tongue. The meat came in a plate with scissors and tongs. The meat didn't taste fresh at all, the ribeye was too dark in color which almost looked frozen. The raw beef tongue meat felt like it was shaven from a frozen piece of tongue. They were all frozen. The pork was slathered in sweet marination which did not assist in enhancing the flavors. Overall, we were utterly disappointed with their current standards.

They only have black pepper sauce as a flavour in which was a bit of a disappointment for a restaurant that serves different types of meat. I ordered their sirloin and it was very very dry, even when it was cooked to medium rare. There was an odd layer of rosemary season on the meat which should not be paired with beef. Rosemary is often for Lamb, not beef!My friends ordered the marinated meat skewers and they were equally as dry. Service was neither slow or fast, but rather you could see the waiters just 'lepak' (laze around) when there was nothing to do. I don't think this would be my first or second or third choice if I happen to be back in Johor again. Show less",2.0,Reviewed 13 December 2017 ,Sizzling Stonegrill

The only meal that was good was my dad's seafood set because he ate it before the food overcooked. The sides were mediocre, fried rice and microwaved corn as ""vegetables"" lol. Service is passable, the waiters seemed impatient and judgy, but maybe that's cuz we arrived at like 9:30pm. We asked for extra plates (so our food wouldn't burn) which we were given reluctantly, but I feel should be standard because of the nature of the way the food is cooked.Price-wise was reasonable.

My husband and I like that we can cook our own steaks on the red-hot stone provided. He likes his steak medium, and I want mine very well done. We've tried the sirloin, the boneless ribeye and the tenderloin. Our favorite is the tenderloin. And it is a good sized serving. See pictures below. You can order with two sides consisting of baked potato, french fries and mixed vegetables. I like the french fries so I order two sides of those. Husband likes the mixed vegetables so he gets fries and veggies. We are American, so we like having iced tea with our meal. Their tea is very good, and if you ask, they will serve it plain with the sugar syrup separate. We haven't tried any of the local dishes, but always see lots of Asian folks enjoying the local noodle dishes. They smell good, and look delicious!

I believe they are using charcoal as the chicken tasted smoky in a good way; a unique taste. The roasted pork belly skin was crispy even though it‚Äôs not piping hot which I liked. Char siew more of the lean meat type but personally preferred the one with both lean meat and fats. They do sell ÁÉßÂåÖ char siew pastry and Portuguese egg tarts as well. The skin of the char siew pastries was crispy and flaky. The char siew fillings were savory which makes it a good combination. However I felt the egg tarts were pretty normal.

They do not have much entertainment as compared to HDL. But we waited and got our seats around 20 minutes. This was faster compared to HDL. After we were seated, we were presented with the electronic menu and briefed on some of the items like drinks and stuff. Interesting choices for the soup base, which we had not seen. Like the green mala soup which we ordered. We had the pork broth as well. The green mala was not as spicy compared to the red ones at HDL. But the soup can literally be drank as it‚Äôs very flavorful as well after I had a try. The surprise was the pork broth which all of us find it very tasty, better than the ones at HDL. The ingredients were all fresh ingredients and therefore, similar to the ones at HDL. One thing we found still needs a lot of improvement to catch up with HDL was the service rendered. They were definitely not as attentive as HDL. They did not have the tissue boxes on the table and the drinks were payable. One commendable service was that my kids were offered the hello kitty cutleries and bowls which made their day.The sauces selection was ample and more than adequate.

Which was a good sign as the restaurant was packed with locals. We ordered a number of dishes and we went for the prime rib for the bah kut teh.The broth was light but infused with a herbal taste to it. I believed the reason for this was to cater to the mass market, not to have a strong taste. The prime ribs were good, but I wished it was a bit softer, maybe another thirty minutes of cooking. The salted vegetables were pretty average.

Request for extra sauce was denied too citing its limited for each meal (Total joke!). There was even an 10% service charge when there were NO SERVICES at all.

Vanilla ice cream with nut powder sprinkle on top is yum. But the brownie was burnt,taste n smell burnt. Another dessert Sizzling banana w chocolate ice cream RM12.90,the banana is fried without flour coated.Overall spend,RM114.15.

235elainey,Not bad for a leisurely meal... plenty of choices,"VDM GALLERIE CAFENice and cosy place. We were out of luck because 3 items we ordered weren't available. So either business was too good or perhaps they've offered too much variety in their menu that makes proper menu planning/mise en place a bit messy. Either way, it was 12.30 nn so unavailable item on the menu isn't really good news, especially for first timers.However, they have an interesting mix of menu items that caught my attention. Mostly western and some fusion. There's just so much to choose from. Nice food presentation too.We finally settled with the chicken chop and some 'onigiri-like' mixed grain rice ball with stir fried beans and mushrooms. Chicken chop cleverly flattened to ensure that it's evenly cooked with light, crispy skin and tender meat. (My guess: grilled skin down under low heat?). Served with black pepper sauce on the side and fried fries, fruits, an egg, bun and salad greens. Loved the fact that it's simple and just lightly seasoned. The rice balls were good although I think pairing it (mixed grain rice) with only stirfried veges (pretty good) seems a bit dry and plain. Perhaps they should consider adding some seasoned kombu(my fave!), or whatever filling like what the Japanese do with the onigiri. It makes the rice more appetizing. If they wanna keep it Chinese , how about a bit of preserved olive leaves as filling? Just my opinion anyway. I do think the price is a bit pricey for something this plain. Beverage: appreciate the fact that the drinks weren't too sweet. Overall, the cafe is cosy, and clean. Nice decor too. You need to take your shoes off at the entrance. Notes: While the tables and everything else is clean, attention to details in terms of serving gears and plates is needed. My iced coffee was served on a rectangular wooden tray that looked like it's been wet for too long and turned black and moldy(see pix). Not cool. The handles of the knives were sorta blackish . The spoon in my iced coffee was shorter than the glass(see attached video). The spoon used to spoon out the cincau jelly cubes could barely scoop anything. It was a hard chore trying to eat the cincau jellies (and nope, can't get through the straw too) so we ended up pouring the last 1/3 cup of the longan -cincau drink into my finished iced coffee glass. One more thing, if you are hungry or in a hurry, you may want to think twice. Otherwise, this is a nice place for a leisurely meal. Parking, (at this moment ) can be a problem.

It is not a cafe, despite the name, but a full-fledged restaurant opened for dinners only from 5pm to 10pm daily.

We didn't have to wait to be served and our orders came within a reasonable time despite the fact that the dishes did not seem to be using much processed ingredients but fresh ingredients. The dishes had a clean taste and were not drowned by too much sauces or spices, which is a common feature of food served in Johor Bahru restaurants.

The food concept is unique as I have never eaten Nasi Lemak with expensive seafood before. The Crab Nasi Lemak costs RM40 and the Sotong Nasi Lemak costs RM28. The crab and sotong are fresh and meaty. My friend mentioned that the meat was stuck in the crab. As my crab, the meat did come off easily. I feel that the sotong and crab were steamed before grilling, giving them a moist texture inside but grilled on the outside. The sotong was served with garlic butter. The long grain rice with the sambal is the star. The rice was served warm. The food was flavourful but not salty. It is expensive crab in Singapore but I feel satisfied that I could eat it in JB. My only vibe is the smell of crab lingered on my hands even after three hand wash with soap. However, the smell of crab on my hands was gone after a few hours. Service & Ambience The staff was brisk but not warm or rude. He was competent because he wrote down our orders on an order chit but he managed to serve our order for 13 people without mistake. The place was air-conditioned. There was a slight seafood smell when I entered but I soon got used it to the smell. Opening Hours Food was served very quickly when I was there at 11pm. However, my friend told me that the wait was long during dinner time. Their business was so good that they extended their space to another unit next door. They open till late - 12midnight which I find it rather unusual in JB. They are closed on 2 Wednesday in a month. Do check their opening hours before going down on Wed.

Even the plum sauce that came with it was significantly watered down and the taste is not as strong as before.Ordered the claypot beancurd. The sauce was good and it went well with the rice.

The pork was fine but the salted fish had absolutely no taste to it. I took a chunk of the salted fish and ate it without anything else and it had absolutely no taste to it.

Not sure how to order, menu is confusing, wait staff also not sure what to suggest to patrons 3) Payment, also confusing. Have to enter a boutique (street wear) to pay 4) Only Mee Rebus is ok. The Sangkut Fried Rice is horrible. 5) Beverage ordering process was seriously slow. Took some minutes for the wait staff to inform that no coffee available. Seriously?! 6) Not friendly for kids, as the whole place is smoking zone. Unless you want your kids to pick up smoking. 7) If the cafe is striking to be different, it scores in terms of weird arrangement of seating, tables, but failed in functionality 8) the owner needs to remember this is a food outlet, serve good food is also crucial, not just the style.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 1 November 2017 ,IstanaSangkut Kitchen

The neon decor inside depicts several kungfu figures (beware of copyright infringement... a restaurant chain in China is recently being sued by Bruce Lee's family for using his image as logo without consent). ""Kungfu"" obviously refers to the effort the kitchen put on the dishes, but the Chinese signboard suggests only Wengchun as the Kungfu they are using, conveniently borrowed from the popular Hongkong movies.Might not be that bad right I guess? Wrong.The menu is so disoriented and unorganized. One has to mix and match his choices of noodle, side dishes and soup. I know this maximize profit but it's just confusing. You have no idea how much are you paying for the meal until you solve the math puzzle. And that's not the worst.The waitress did not know the ordering sequence too when asked. She got the captain, an arrogant chap. The show begun.He told me at a fast pace flipping the menu impatiently how to get my order done. And on the font page you need to decide what type of noodle ingredient, namely xxx and potato. Excuse me, potato noodle? The Chinese writing was ""ÂúüË±Ü ground nut"", which in local Hokkien dialect it is nothing but peanut. Mandarin for potato is È¶¨Èà¥ËñØ. I told the chap how it should have been perceived. Moreover not all parts of mainland China term potato as ""ground nut"", it is more colloquial than professional. He obviously got pissed and started to argue to make his points heard. He said all of their ingredients came from China as such the terms in the menu follow. Well either he was naive, oblivious or ignorant, or just trying to cover the typo mistake. Guess what, he walked off.I walked off too, of course.There is not a single reason for me to dine at Kungfu Noodle while there are many just across the aisle.

Staff were inefficient and unprofessional.The muffins and drinks came first -they were okay. The food arrived an hour after placing the order. The portions of the set meals were so small and looked unappealing to say the least. The minestrone soup was cold with soggy crumbs of bread in it. It honestly looked like someone else's leftover. The rice looked and tasted old. The chicken tasted like it was going to get spoilt and really bland. Ended up just leaving the restaurant without eating. A total waste of money and time!

We arrived around 8pm and parking was quite limited, so I dropped off my family and found a spot 50 meters away. Food choices and prices were basically the same throughout this food court. If you sit in front of a certain stall, they will insist that all food and drinks are only ordered from that stall. Seafood is generally the best option, and most are quite fresh. You can basically ask them to stir-fried with sambal, soy sauce or oyster sauce, deep-fry, steamed or boil your orders and most stalls have very able cooks manning them. We ordered Siakap Masak Tiga Rasa or 3 Flavours Seabass which was lovely. Stir-fried Mussels or Kepah Goreng was delicious. Tomyam Campur or Mixed Tomyam Soup was delicious but you can ask them not to make it too spicy. Vegetables we opted for Kangkung Goreng Belacan or Water Spinach stifried with Prawn Paste. For drinks we ordered fruit juices that came in giant tall glasses, and you can ask lychee with watermelon or Air Tembikai Laici which was refreshing. For 4 people, the price charged was reasonable.

Service wise, the staff were friendly and attentive enough including the chefs. The sumptuous buffet spread for all three main meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner had many varieties to choose from and we were really spoilt for choice. For breakfast, roti canai was freshly prepared and fried, for lunch and dinner there was even pasta, japanese selections and grilled meats/fish and roasts that were freshly cooked and served in front of us. Except for the salmon for the sushi that did not look too fresh, I was happy with the dishes that I tasted. The pasta could be more varied in its sauces or the way it could be cooked or served. What I love and remember the most about this restaurant is its sweet porridge or bubur. Everyday there would be at least three varieties of bubur (gandum,kacang merah, kacang hijau, pulut hitam) and even serawa durian cooked with a generous amount of santan, thick and creamy. To me, bubur must be cooked the traditional way with the right amount of thick santan. No such thing as cutting down on the santan as it will affect the original taste. The bubur at the Infusion restaurant was the best that I have tasted so far. Period.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 3 May 2015 ,Infusion
Geetha B,Lunch buffet,Decent spread. Had a good pick at grill corner. Dessert was ok. Not overpriced for an international buffet. Great environment. Avoid school holidays - crowded & eventually lack of staff hospitality.,3.0,Reviewed 14 March 2015 ,Infusion
roseauroraSingapore,like it but wld love to see more varieties,"i had breakfast there for 2 straight morning. i had nasi lemak for both days, only different main dish, the 2nd day was with beef rendang.. roti canai is nice too, but be sure to choose the ones they just make, if not it'll be cold & a lil hard. there's was also a congee,egg,pastries, western stations. on the 2nd day there was also lontong & waffles. but the restaurant lighting was a bit gloomy. we had to choose the windows seats for brighter view but not much to see outside.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 29 January 2015 ,Infusion

"GrgeousJohor Bahru, Malaysia",Decent but also dissapointing,"We visited to have a buffet on Sunday night and were excited to try it out the very first time. The buffet mostly catered to local dishes like nasi lemak and other Chinese food the most. However the grill section is not much of a variety and so as the Japanese food section. I was quite disappointed with the wasabi which is totally tasteless. The staffs are not knowledgeable of what was served in the buffet and when I asked a general question like ""do you serve chicken here"", she said no. However I managed to find them myself. Unless they improve the variety of choices of food to match the theme of international buffet, if not, I do not think I will go back again.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 18 November 2014 ,Infusion

mimie_amelliasingapore,Good place!,"After reading about their negative comments i personally think they had a massive change on the staffs. Service was great, friendly staffs and always on the look out. Food choice was great and plenty. Was there for dinner and breakfast and both was just awesome. Will be there again hopefully one day. Even though my toddler was not feeling well and had puked in the restaurant, they did not make a kind of face at us instead when i apologised, a manager actually said its okay politely without looking annoyed or pissed.Thank you for the great service!

"piagetSingapore, Singapore",Value for money sumptuous buffet in Johor Baru :-),"Situated conveniently on the 2nd floor of KSL City, this restaurant was a God send. If you are driving , there is plenty of parking available at the basement. There is even a marked lift which you can take directly from the basement to 'G' floor , where the restaurant is located. If taking bus or taxi, it should take no more than 10min from the Johor customs or CIQ.I did not make reservations but there was plenty of tables available. The staff were very efficient and we were sitted less than 3min when we arrived.Now to the food. My favourite is definitely the poached prawns on ice. Fresh and heavenly! For my daughter , the scallops are her favourites. With a wide variety of salads at the salad bar (frankly not many people go there, i guess to indulge in other cholestrol busting treats...hehehe...evil laughter). It simply makes you feel less guilty when devouring the lamb goulash, BBQ lamb, fish etc. Yup, there is even BBQ fish, my wife's favourite. Unfortunately, no BBQ stingray, which would have made this restaurant an excellent rating.There is a wide variety of Asian dishes. Give the mini murtabaks a miss, they do much injustice to the delicious mini murtabaks that I have tasted elsewhere.There is 1 negative for this restaurant buffet experience. My boys were disappointed at the lack of cold drinks choices like fruit juices which were extra and i guess were not included in the price. There is free flow of tea and coffee. The ice cream and desserts section was 1 of my daugther favourite treats, especially it fondue fountain where she return to every 10min.My suggestion for this restaurant is to include wraps or mini breads near the salad bar. Rice is too heavy for dinner. There are at least 3 varieties of rice. Normal white, yam etc. For the hot drinks section, kindly include brown sugar.For its price, this restaurant is definitely worth every single cent and for families looking for deals, this can't be beat. I highly recommend this restaurant for family dinner. For smokers, there is even a smoking section located near the BBQ section - talk about great customer service.There is even a 50% discount for seniors above 60 but kids above 12 may adult rate. Hehehe...my 13yr son wolfed down at least 10 BBQ lamb so i guess paying adult rate was justified in this case.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 21 October 2012 ,Infusion
