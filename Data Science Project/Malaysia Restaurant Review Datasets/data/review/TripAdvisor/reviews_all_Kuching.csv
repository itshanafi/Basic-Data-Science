"Sharmini_VioletLangkawi, Malaysia",I'm a happy foodie brought back in time at The Bikalan! ,"We reached The Bikalan located at the little Siniawan pekan(small township) by crossing the river by boat from one of the Siniawan kampungs. That itself was an experience I would not forget. But that was just one to many great things of The Bikalan experience. I love old architecture and when i saw Bikalan and the little Siniawan town street, I felt I was taken back in time like in the movies of an old cowboy town.. all was missing were horse carriages. This gave a great feel, to add to this, Andy the 'Tokey' of Bikalan was giving us a run down on the history of Siniawan and what it has become today. Andy's wife (the other but the big 'Tokey') is a native Bidayuh and so I was excited to try the Bidayuh food served here. As what many have mentioned, the food here is the best, and you will come back for more for sure. Check out my pics for the food I had , I'm a vege lover (im not vegetarian) so I was a happy woman here. They have quite an extensive menu so means i have to come back to try many more dishes. Btw they have many many types of drinks here.. of course not forgeting the tuak and langkau. Tuak was ok for me.. but me no fan of langkau .. maybe i stay with my Gin and Tonic ! Or guinness draft! Back to the outlook of the place .. it is interestingly decorated with picture memories of the Siniawan town history, and mainly of all the faces that has grazed Bikalan. I hope we get our pic up too I too want to be on Bikalan's wall of fame! Lastly thanks to the good looking and plesant staffs.. of course to the cooks that made me happy tummy, and to Tokey Andy and Tokey Grace for your hospitality! We sending over people to you and we will be there again for sure! Show less",5.0,Reviewed yesterday ,The Bikalan
"GoPlaces20758429304Chennai (Madras), India","The most memorable meal in Sarawak by far, at the Bikalan, Siniawan !","We arrived at the Bikalan as guests on a strong recommendation and left as freinds ! Grace & Andy the lovely couple behind this hidden gem in Siniawan, a historic town an hour + from Kuching, make the Bikalan experience truly memorable. Its a non halal haven with great signature cocktails & the finest pork delicacies ! Must try the 'Bikalan Bastard' and 'Bikalan Burner' signature cocktails with a,sarawakian twist, infused with local herbs, spices. The bikalan also brews its own ' Tuak ' . Offered in 3 flavours/ variants, we carried a bottle back home with us as a souvenir ! Grace personally supervises her culinary team & has kept her family and sarawakian recipes alive at The Bikalan. Its an English Pub with a distinct Sarawakian twist, in the historic trading town of Siniawan, which makes for a truly unique dining experience. Our meal was by far the best on a 4 day trip to Sarawak. Do not miss the Signature Bikalan 3 layered pork Stew, which is steamed for over 6 hours andh literally melts in ur mouth ! Dont miss the Kolo mee goreng with omelette and the Cripy ginger pork, a layered pork delicacy marinated in fermented tofu & deep fried with ginger.

"ShaunNolan45Kuching, Malaysia",Riverside Rest,"I dropped into The Bikalan recently and tried their Dynamite Sticks (big chillies stuffed with spicy pork and cheese, wrapped in a wanton skin) and, suffice to say, they blew my mind. Not only did they taste good, but they had a decent kick, albeit one of those slow, sneaky kicks that creeps up from behind and… wallop! If the Dynamite Sticks aren’t hot enough for you, The Bikalan’s very own firecracker, Grace, will be sure to get your temperature soaring with her sassy ways. She sure knows how to run a bar, as does her other half, Andy, who’s the salt of the earth and will see to it that you feel like a member of the The Bikalan family by the time you leave.

Jimmy86TravellerMalaysia,A Bikalan Night to remember!,"So i have been working for past 2 years in Kuching town and heard so much stories about this place in Siniawan. However due to the strict Movement control Order due to C-19, the idea of visiting this area was placed on hold until recently when the contagion is pretty much surpressed. It was a friday night at around 730pm and we were a little hungry and decided to give a go and drove about 30minutes out of Kuching city to this reknowned and ""spoken-of by many"" famous eatery. A friend of mine who knew his way around drove and we ended up in a quiet village and parked our car behind a row of shoplots. We walked through a small alley and to my surprise, there Bikalan stood, smack in the centre at a corner-central shop lot, well-lit with great ambience. There were a few tables of customers (which i assumed were regulars because they all seem to know the owner rather well). So we got ourselves registered (C-19 protocol) and found a nice seat at the entrance by the bar. Then came a Englishman who introduced himself and asked if were here for dinner or drinks. When we told him we were hungry, he stood there and recommended the dishes according to our dietary habits (some vegetarian, some non-beef dishes) but most importantly its his Pork Skin Snack/ tapas! A friend ordered the pork burger and we all just had to dig in our fork for a taste of it and, without any dissappointment, its was DE-LI-CIOUS! We also had other dishes involving egg products and stir fried noodle with vege which was super tasty! Nothing was left on the table and straight into the tummy. (Yes, i did say were hungry, but we are all still food critics despite the hunger, so I am not bias when i say the food was Yummi-licious!)Moving on the the drinks, the girls had wine and we had our beer (stout and estrella), refreshing and just great. The Englishman (i wont disclose his name to you all, so please ask yourselves) who happens to be the owner kept going around checking-in with his customers to get positive and negative feedback and it is great of him to do so. It was rather fun to be able to chat with him and know about how Bikalan came about. We also met his wife, who is so cheerful, happy and living her life at the restaurant and we all had a great time having to get to know each other better and they were great company to our table. It was all laughters and happiness, till the shop has to close due to operating hours restriction SOP. We ended the night with sanitized fist bumps and went home. One day when we are back to be able to have a bigger crowd, we will definately bring more friends and family here.

riderchris,The BEST in Kuching!,"As I've travelled quite extensively in South East Asia, I must say Bikalan is one of my favourite bars that I've been to. Situated just about 25KM from Kuching city, Bikalan is a laid back bar, serving authentic local cuisine and they offer a great range of alcohol/foods to fill up your night. Their food/drinks pricings are quite affordable and we really enjoyed the Bikalan, you don't get this kind of atmosphere anywhere in Malaysia. Imagine having a good draught beer next to a river in a Belian wood shop house in Siniawan's historic main bazaar. The owners (Andy & Grace) are down to the earth person. If you're going there, ask Andy about the history of the place, he would love to explain it to you. Tips: If you're going here, make sure you arrange cab/taxi/grab on your way back in advance.

stevenquint,Most original restaurant in the area. Great place.,"I lived near the Siniawan area for 5 years as one of the few Western residents. The opening of the Bikalan was most welcome. A lot of restaurants in the area tend to copycat one another in terms of how their food tastes and how you get served. Well, the Bikalan is definitely original. Their food isn't merely great, it stands out. I am friends with the owners Grace and Andy, after visiting the Bikalan numerous times, and they're super friendly and conversational. They run their restaurant with a positive energy that goes unmatched. Meet them and see for yourself. The live bands and customer service are some of the best I've ever encountered. You won't find this anywhere else in the area. With all this great stuff you'd think it would be expensive, but it's actually a really great deal. I've entertained parties of 10+ people at the Bikalan without straining my wallet. You'll get more in return than what you pay.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 25 March 2020 ,The Bikalan

Look no further than the Bikalan. Andy and Grace, the owners, have created something really special here in the heart of the Siniawan Night Market.There is a wonderful choice of food - local dishes or fish and chips if you really fancy it. Ate there four times during our stay in the area and can honestly say that the food we had there was the best of our entire trip. Andy and Grace are such a friendly couple. Nothing is too much trouble and they will help you decide what food to order. They are open six nights a week (Tuesday to Sunday), but if you want the full Siniawan experience, then go on a Friday or Saturday or Sunday.

They are such an adorable, warm and welcoming couple, you feel comfortable from the very first moment. They built a pub out of an abandoned house in the center of the small oldtown and they created something beautiful here. They helped us choose something to eat (my girlfriend is a vegetarian) and we loved it. All the ingredients are fresh and local. Surprisingly most dishes are local/asian but you will be able to get your burger-fix here as well. Needless to say the drinks are on the same amazing level. While we initially just wanted to grab something to eat and wait for the nightmarket to get going, we eventually spent the whole night there talking to Andy and Grace. They even called a friend of them to pick us up and drive us back to Kuching when we couldn't find a Grab-Driver (which sadly seems to be quite normal, so maybe find a driver who's willing to wait for you).If you are staying in Kuching try to come out to Siniawan and enjoy the atmosphere even if the nightmarket isn't open.

David G,Come to Siniawan - and The Bik!,"Discovered this gem of a joint in mid- July this year. Run by the ever-effusive and accommodating Andy and Grace, this terrific, eclectic and welcoming bar is a must-visit if you find yourself in this funky little township half an hour outside the big smoke of Kch.There's a great range of beers on offer from the bargain basement Estrella at 6 ringgit up to more pricey offerings including Heineken and Guinness on tap. Additionally there are awesome cocktails on offer and the local rice wine Tuak is fantastic. All of this is backed up by fantastic range of both local and western cuisine - we can vouch for the fish and chips, great burgers, excellent fried rice and local pork dishes and moreish bar snacks like crispy pork skin and chicken wings and the to-die-for dynamite sticks (pork and cheese in long spicy red chillies wrapped in wonton a deep fried.)Easily the find of the year, The Bik should be on any itinerary to Sarawak.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 10 July 2019 ,The Bikalan

"Stephen LTwickenham, United Kingdom","A good bar, not expected to be there","I met Andy the owner during a family meal (up to 40 of us) in the stalls outside the pub. Whilst the pub does food (what I sampled was good) there's a lot outside. Beer was cold and reasonable, it's open and airy, quite busy when we were there and also had screens. It looks like a lot of ex-pat bars, but did not have the ex-pats and generally local customers. Overall very good - my only faults are 1) the stupidly loud Chinese karaoke three doors away that spoils not just this bar entrance but everything within 100 yards and 2) a few obnoxious local customers who thought making fun of passing travellers was fun (just before I entered the bar). So nice bar, shame about some of the locals. Hopefully they will learn as clearly Andy is keen to make it a good place and he's doing well.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 29 April 2019 ,The Bikalan

"CamMichealSingapore, Singapore",Great night out,"A great find. A truly local bar, great mix of local patrons with a smattering of western tourists. I chatted with tourists from Indonesia, Maldives and the UK as well as local Chinese and Dayaks. The location is just spectacular. Siniawan, at night, is an assault on the senses. The historical setting in old wooden shophouses dating back to the 1870’s, all still retaining their original design. The whole street is lit up with red lanterns and the smell of all the food being cooked from local Malays cooking satays, local Chinese cooking a multitude of different local specialty dishes and the local Dayaks cooking their dishes and the music from karaoke, live bands or playlists. Your eyes, ears and nose are overwhelmed with this wild kaleidoscope of smells, sights and noise. It great. Bikalan is on the river side of the street and has a great deck over looking the river where you enjoy a drink while watching Sampans ferrying local back and forth across the river.Fair priced drinks and fantastic local food that extend well past the usual bowls of noodles that seem to so much the standard local fair. I had squid and okra cooked in shrimp paste, pork fried in ginger and BBQ Stingray. Great to also find a local bar that understands the importance of a Cold Beer but does have options of wine and even a good range of local rice wine (tuak) which are surprisingly good.

"stonnergSydney, Australia",A must visit while in Sarawak.,"I got shown The Bikalan pub by a friend I made in Kuching and it quickly became a highlight for me in Sarawak. It’s a beautifully kitted out pub with a (TV showing sports and great sound system) but still kept in with the style of local village, wide selection of beers, spirits, wine which are local and imported. The street it sits on offers a wide range of street food which you’re allowed to take into the bar if you wish. My friend introduced me to Andy and grace who are the owners, all I can say is that they are fantastic hosts, brilliant company to be around and made me feel like a local as soon as I arrived, as well as the whole atmosphere of the bar and the street itself it’s a perfect place to spend a weekend. So much so I came back for a second nightBut asides from the great company, heavy drinking, good music and football on the telly. It’s also a restaurant and the food they serve was some of the best I had during my time in Sarawak, I tried some of the local dishes from the recommendations and grace & Andy (with some ingredients home grown too!) and it didn’t disappoint, from the noodles, fried pork, tapioca, chicken wings, stingray (for the first time for me, I recommend it) plus many other dishes that I tried I can honesty say I probably put on half a stone which I didn’t feel guilty about as it was that enjoyable. They also have regular live music down there too with highly rated local bands, unfortunately for me I didn’t get chance to see one. But that gives me a great excuse to comeback.All I can say is don’t let the 20 minute taxi drive out of Kuching put you off from going, it’s well worth your time!Thanks again and all the bestMarkShow less",5.0,Reviewed 7 March 2019 ,The Bikalan
Skav88,"So much more than a bar, in Siniawan, Kuchings best kept secret!","Where to start with the Bikalan? Accessible via road, about 35 minutes from the city centre. Even better if you can approach across the river it sits next to, which is just breathtaking and such a cool way to arrive somewhere for the evening. Sitting next to a beautiful river, surrounded by a historic town that is beautifully maintained and the cultural heartbeat of the local area. The Bikalan has that feel of a local pub, where anyone can be a local, you instantly feel at home. On weekends there is the incredible Siniawan night market providing so much incredible food available from some of the friendliest and most welcoming people I have ever met. Now The Bikalan, built on the site of a former general store, the Bikalan has been the brainchild of Grace and Andy, with so much love and support from the local community. Bringing life back to a building after 10 years and becoming a focal point for the stree. From design to build it has been created to provide an awesome environment in a great setting, the place to meet interesting people, eat incredible food, drink and even dance the pocho-pocho (as at the bar for lessons!) Grace, Andy and the team are awesome, the locals are incredible and you will never leave hungry or without a huge smile n your face!.Personally one of my favourite places and I have taken so many visitors and they have all loved it.

We checked it out on a Saturday night and loved every minute of it. The whole ambience of sitting on one of The Bik's tables street side with a good bunch of people, and a few too many beers, and watching the bustling night market work its charm was special. For a newly opened place the service was spot on. As there was a large group of us we ordered many different dishes off the menu and they were all fantastic. Highly recommend the crispy spicy pork.We were lucky enough to be in Sarawak for a month so went back to Siniawan a few times and even caught a live band The Bik had on one night who were awesome. It's safe to say we got a bit carried away and had a dance or two but half the bar was singing and dancing at that stage!Saving the best til last, all the above wouldn't have been half the same without the unreal hospitality of Grace and Andy.

The food was great and we got to try some vegan versions of traditional Malaysian food including Nasi Lemak with Tempe rendang and many fillings for canai. They also serve western burgers, pasta, and sandwiches. We did their cookery course (which you can do with meat or vegan) and learned to make some great dishes (it made for a biiiig lunch afterwards), they even gifted us some Laksa paste to take away with us. We also booked all of our excursions through them, this included a day trip to Bako national park with a local specialist guide, and a kayaking trip down Sarawak river. Trudy and Lucian were really helpful in getting these trips booked last minute and made sure to notify the trips of our vegan food requirements.

Trudy and her husband Colin are the most wonderful, friendly and trustworthy people one could meet. We worked with Trudy from Australia to arrange all of our activities. We started out time with them by doing Trudy's cooking class. She met us at the market to buy the food and then on to the cooking class. I would rate this activity as an 11 out of 10. Even those in the group who were not enthusiastic to begin with loved the morning. We were in Kuching for 4 days and prior to arriving Trudy had helped me chose all ouf our activities and arrange them for us. We then went on to do jungel tours and visit the local longhouse village etc. It was all wonderful. My recommendation to anyone visiting Kuching is to work with Trudy for suggestions and then book it through her. All the guides were amazing.

After a time traveling we were taken with the healthy food beautifully presented. Everything was delicious and fresh. The food handling practice was high and everything kept chilled.

There is a lovely personalised feel to this tour and we were thrilled to be introduced to them (rather than the usual trip that goes round all the major hotels.)Thanks so much for a fantastic time and the great advice!Show less,5.0,Reviewed 21 July 2018 ,Indah House Kuching

If you prefer to go local, ask for one of the Malaysian favorites like nasi lemak, a delightful rice dish. Indah Cafe's decor blends well with the locality, exotic and quaint. It's a historic/heritage area. In fact, Kuching derived its name from an old well now buried under one of the shop houses in Upper China St. It's the name given by early traders from China. The claim that Kuching is named after the cat is a huge factual error, totally non-historic basis. There are very limited tables and chairs in this cafe. Displays of arts and crafts may distract you from feeling cramped though. If you're prepared to climb up the steep and narrow stairs, there are some more arts and crafts up there.

Judy, Colin and the team were so friendly and chatty we ended up spending so much time here and laughing to the point of jaw ache. Their food is extremely tasty too - the beef Nasi Lemak was gorgeous.We also took the opportunity to take part in one of their cooking lessons and market tours. Judy and Colin drove us to a local market where Judy introduced us to new fruit, veggies and spices whilst buying the ingredients for our lesson. We then went back to the cafe and met Emma who showed us what to do with all our purchases to make a truly beautiful meal. We laughed and laughed all morning - Emma has an awesome sense of humour! I cannot speak highly enough of the cafe and the team. They made us feel so welcome and their food, art and cafe are just fantastic. If I come back to Borneo I'll pop in again for sure. Thanks guys!

I was actually excited to introduce my parents to this place initially because I liked their food. But this time was a huge disappointment because of the way we were treated. When we arrived, we were told by the owner that he would have given our table to someone else if he knew we were showing up one person short, and even emphasised that we took a “good” table. Making it sound like such a huge loss for him. Which shows utter lack of professionalism and respect for their guests. Should have walked out the moment he said that.

They were served squelchy and with a weird salty gravy which is not how bbq spare ribs should be. I had spaghetti Agli Olio and couldn’t work out why it tasted odd until I realised the garlic was burnt black and had rendered the whole dish with a burnt after-taste. We ate the majority of our food but no one came and asked us how our food was - nor were we asked when our plates were cleared. Given the price and my disappointment I felt compelled to tell the waiter that we weren’t impressed. I was nice about it and I told him why and he even acknowledged the burnt black garlic on my plate. We weren’t looking for any money off however we were barely even offered an apology - the manager either wasn’t told or she chose not to acknowledge it but either way we were slapped with a 200 dollar bill for a fairly rubbish meal with no real responsibility for poor performance taken.

The dish was served sliced beautifully against the grain with a beautifully charred crust and a generous serving of coarse sea salt to compliment the natural flavours of this Spanish import. The beautiful marbling and fat content makes this dish a winner.

The food was beautifully cooked and served. My Pork Ribs fell off the bone and was really tasty. The cheesecake was massive, probably only needed half the portion, and my husband said that there was too much chocolate on the profiteroles (but I'm sure there's no such thing as too much chocolate! !).

When your orders are taken, they will take the initiative to ask whether you would like your mains to be served with your appetizers or separately - a gesture I really do appreciate especially when I normally order their cold cuts and cheese platters. Two dishes which I am never disappointed with, would be their goat cheese salad and their wagyu beef steak - highly recommended! Their staff are well-trained and friendly and very attentive to your needs. This place is also great for their selections of wine, cocktails, gin and so on.

"Michael199002Swansea, United Kingdom",Awful!! A rip off.,"We visited as a group of 8. I had recommended the place following a previous visit with my wife the week before. 6 of our group decided to go for the pork and chorizo paella which I had last time. We waited approximately 45 minutes for the food to arrive and then when it arrived it was the same size portion as the portion I had received on my previous visit but this time it was apparently a portion for 6. Therefore we had to pay MYR210 for a portion of paella that could barely feed 6 toddlers. The hostess agreed to charge us MYR140 rather than MYR210 which was still very much overpriced. The excuse we were given was that the chef had got it wrong yet the hostess said he wanted to cook it in one dish to maintain as much flavour as possible. We left the place having paid very much over the odds, feeling hungry and even more disgruntled. Will definitely never return again.

Mind you, it isn't empty (we were there from 7.30pm to 10pm!) and it was 80% full the entire time.

Throughout our dinner, we never had to wait too long for our food but that doesn't mean food was served cold. It was freshly cooked and food was lovely!

Brilliant fusion of food, and the prawns were fresh and delicious too!- Dr. Loosen's Riesling, which is a German white wine that was so smooth on the throat that the husband and I had finished the whole bottle without even realising it.

We were warmly greeted by a French lady who assisted us with the menu and the selection of dishes, most of them with a clear Spanish influence.Starting with an interesting basil version of a classic Mojito cocktail, we shared some Iberico Croquetas (potatoes croquettes with some Spanish cured ham), Chicken & Bacon Skewers, a Cheese Board (sampling some French and Spanish cheeses) and a Margherita Pizza. Both the Croquetas and the Skewers were nice and tasty, the cheese selection was not bad while the pizza was decent though its cheese topping was not too fresh.We ordered then a Prawn Aglio Olio Spaghetti (we were served linguine instead) a Saudi Arabia Red Sea Shrimps & Barramundi and a Spanish Suckling Lamb Shoulder. The pasta was cooked ""al dente"" and the fish & seafood were fresh and tasty. A special mention for the Lamb Shoulder, a clear stand out and a must try dish that was melting in the mouth with each bite.We ended the food feast with a decent Crema Catalana, Spanish version of Crème brûlée, and a not so impressive espresso coffee (no surprises here).Overall food quality was good with few flaws; service was nice and warm and we really felt welcome throughout the whole dinner.The final bill (RM 470.00) was relatively high for the local standards but we felt it was partially justified by the cost of the imported ingredients.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 29 May 2016 ,Zinc Restaurant and Bar

Their mains were delivered, eaten and plates removed before our paella was delivered. We watched enviously. Then our paella appeared - no apology, no comment, nothing from the waiter. Just dumped on the table and ran away.Sorry that's not top shelf performance.

Lighting which is often overlooked in restaurants was lovely, soft and ambient. We had some lovely cocktails to start followed by chicken skewers, very tasty. We were seated under a large fan and found it to be quite cold, our issue was dealt with immediately by the staff and the ceiling fan was turned down to low. I had the vegetarian pizza made with feta from Borneo,loved it. My husband had lamb mousakka which he enjoyed, he had cheesecake for dessert while I ordered the much acclaimed chilli chocolate mousse with vanilla ice cream. Due to the strong punchy flavours of the chilli this desert was very filling-about right for two people sharing with I would suggest an extra scoop of ice cream.I could only manage to finish half.

When I heard they were serving lobster that week I just had to go!But our experience wasn't good, especially since it was the most expensive dinner during our entire holiday in Malaysia. First of all, the menu is somewhat weird. It has a bunch of drinks on several pages before you stumble upon the food menu. They don't have a clear starters or main courses menu and the items to choose from didn't really make sense: they serve foie gras and escargots, steak, then all of a sudden a pasta carbonara, a salad. As a menu it just didn't make any sense.My partner didn't really know what to choose so I talked him into sharing the pasta and the lobster.The pasta carbonara was nice, decent, nothing overly special (because, how special can a carbonara be?). The lobster was next..... I should've known from the smell it wasn't good. It was very chewy and tasted strong, rancid even. I just couldn't finish it, which the French lady (owner) noticed. When I suggested the lobster hadn't been prepared right, cooked to long or to short, she didn't seem suprised at all and offered us a free dessert. We then orderd a crêpe with glaced oranges. Bleh! That was horrible. The crêpe wasn't crispy but very greasy, the oranges tasted as if they were baked in a dirty pan. We didn't finish it, paid the bill and left. And then I got stuck to the toilet basically all night from that lobster!I really have no idea why this restaurant ranks number 1 on tripadvisor!

Attentive service from owners James and Servane drives the positive vibe of this tastefully fitted restaurant and welcoming watering hole. The wine list is concise but offers well-priced variety.

"TheguyfromfarDubai, United Arab Emirates","Very interesting find - great concept, great food, great people","Totally unplanned, we happened on Zinc. What a great find. From the friendly welcome and the quaint décor the expectations of a good evening was formed and indeed delivered upon. Zinc serves European, more Mediterranean-inspired (in my opinion) food with some twists and interesting combinations. The concept also departs from the traditional starter-mains-desert and provides more of a mix-and-share one, something that worked very well. While one can structure your order in the traditional form, the mix-and-share makes it possible to sample more of the great selection of dishes.The dishes we enjoyed were all of very good quality, well prepared, presented and tasty. The sliced ham, cheese, quince and bread selection worked very well and can certainly be recommended as the starting off point. A small, but good wine selection complements the food well. In addition to the great food experience, the people in the restaurant provided an additional source of enjoyment The staff is friendly and efficient. Very friendly and involved management further complements this. I was also particularly impressed with small things such as the recognition tat a taxi would be needed and arranging this to be ready by the time we are finished with the meal.All in all - a great experience.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 7 May 2015 ,Zinc Restaurant and Bar

The ambience was lovely and we had really attentive staff waiting on us the whole night. The variety on the menu was pretty good too, the Jamon Iberico is something I haven't seen in Kuching before and despite the price, I thought it was really good and it is something nice to be shared among friends. Had the kaffir lime chicken which was juicy on the inside (loved the flavor) but pretty charred on the outside so I had to scrape it off. Same with the steak which some other members of the party had (3 of them in particular had come here twice before and the outside had not been burnt but was lovely and juicy), though we do understand that when you're cooking steaks on the grill that there may be some inconsistencies, the chef himself admitted that (so if it does happen, don't be too alarmed). The order of the food was a little messy, the mains came before all the appetisers and our order of rillettes was unfortunately forgotten but we didn't mind because it was all still yummy, though it would be something that could be improved.I definitely do like how the staff kept checking in on us, making sure we had everything we needed and that our table wasn't getting too cluttered. When we brought up the question of the steaks, that was also quickly attended to.

"gek_leeSingapore, Singapore",A tamed palate,"A halal Dayak restaurant seems a bit tame, no wild boar for a start. Nevertheless a dinner at Lepau is still an adventure. We started with a smoked fish soup with Dayak eggplant was pleasantly smoky and tangy. The smoked fish is nothing like the Scottish sort and is not easy to chew through. Perhaps if cut into smaller chunks and fried till crisp and made into croutons. But maybe such delicate touches would go against the rustic charm of Lepau. The chicken cooked in bamboo was tender although flavor wise it erred on the bland. The sea bass cooked three ways was more exciting to the tase buds. I should have preferred it fried less so the fish retains more moisture. The ferns stir fried with garlic were like super tender asparagus and a must have. We had to try the native bario rice which came nicely wrapped in a leaf. The texture of the rice is somewhat risotto like. Unfortunately we were only a table of three which constrained us from trying more dishes. Try and go with a bigger group for more variety or choose the set dinner which at RM 9/- represents excellent value. Service is friendly and helpful and the food is served quickly.

A true gem of a dining experience!,"Went for dinner on a weeknight.Apart from leaving my umbrella at my table and getting a massive mosquito bite, there was no downside to this dining experience.This was the first truly authentic Sarawak restaurant we went to. Despite eating local cuisine for our previous 3 nights in Sarawak, we had not seen about 60% of the menu that Lepau had before going there.The prices were extremely affordable. The food was expertly prepared Everything was perfectly seasoned. It was some of the best vegetarian food that I have had anywhere. Well seasoned, cooked perfectly, unique combinations and saucing.  Sadly, I cannot locate a menu online and I don't remember the names of the dishes that I ate. I believe one item was the stir fried tapioca leaves with tepus and a local noodle. I believe it was one of the house specials that is a regular feature on its menu. The dessert was also very unique and great. Even the drinks, such as a honey tea, were well done. Our server was excellent. He took time to speak with all guests, make sure that they were enjoying the food, and share his knowledge of Sarawak. It was a well paced meal. I might have tipped him more than the cost of my main! I honestly would have had lunch and dinner here everyday if we had come from day 1. The decor has some traditional touches, but doesn't look tacky or ""themed"". It was well done. The outdoor seating area has an elegant simplicity. The ambiance is laid back and chill.I believe there is a show or live music as there is a stage.

Besides Chinese and Malay cuisines, items in the menu are a mix of indigenous and eclectic ethnic: D'yak, Melanau, Orang Ulu (general and collective reference to Kelabit, Kenyah, Kayan, Lun Bawang groups). If you're adventurous enough, try their umai dish. It's raw sea food cured in lime juice or vinegar, garnished with onion/shallot and chili pepper. Request for lime juice if you don't like vinegar. For vegetable of jungle origin, you have a choice of paku or midin. Both are ferns normally growing in the wild. I prefer paku because it's more succulent. You're allowed to request how you want it cooked. They talk; you choose.You'll be impressed by friendly staff and efficient service. Lepau is an open air restaurant.

"travelandshop2014Montreal, Canada","Blah Blah Blah food, Wow Decor","Went for dinner. Was disappointed given all the positive reviews on TA.Pros:1. beautiful decor - lots of thought was put into this restaurant. It is an impressive place to dine.Cons:1. This is a seafood heavy restaurant. There are not many veggie options. You have to speak with your waiter to create something for you. The veggie options they do have come in large plates and are meant to be shared with 2-3 people. I ordered a plate of Midin (which is a fiddlehead) and some noodles. The noodles were somehow drenched in some sort of weird sauce yet some of them managed not to be cooked. That is an impressive feat. I really didn't care for anything I had. Even the dessert, which I hoped would save the meal (a matcha cake), was nothing memorable other than its price. I can't even say the presentation of any of the meals was exceptional. What I had was in a family style presentation.2. Service - the level of English was decent. Our waitress worked to try and accommodate my allergies. Problem was that she was not overly friendly, but did her job. She seemed a bit annoyed with all of our questions. Walking into the restaurant, you are not greeted by anyone. You have to wait around and flag someone down to be seated.3. Leaky roof- there was a downpour which revealed that some tables are under a leaky roof. Some customers had to be relocated to alternate tables. I also felt that I was getting beaten by mosquitoes. 4. location - it was a bit difficult to find as it is sort of tucked away at its back entrance and has a very high signage at the front entrance. Hard to identify the place unless you ask or look way up. Overall, this was a blah, overpriced dining experience, but the decor is first rate.

In three weeks in Malaysian Borneo (including some high end lodges), this was our best meal. This tasteful retreat is a calm oasis of wood, stone, and water. We ordered house specialties to share...chicken and herbs wrapped in pandana leaves and then deep fried, and, chicken in a rich cashew sauce in an edible bowl. The waitress added deep fried greens, like small, melt in your mouth potatoes chips. And before you worry about so much fried food, rest assured that it was anything but greasy. Chicken has never been so tender, or moist, or flavorful. We lingered over every bite. The menu is varied and unusual. It's an adventurous place.

I have to admit it was tasty and well presented. To end up our bad blablabla experience, the pandan chicken came also raw. This time the waitress admitted it was poorly cooked and offered to replace.

We came on a Sunday evening at 8.00 pm and the restaurant was already full. Bla Bla Bla restaurant seems to be quite new, has a modern decoration and before you enter the kitchen/dining area you cross a small goldfish pond with stone plates to walk over, which we found quite nice. Nobody of the staff was greeting/ welcoming us and everybody seemed to be busy when we entered and were looking for an empty table. We managed to get a small table in the back of the restaurant and after 10 minutes of waiting somebody realized that we were paying guests and we could finally order. We chose pineapple fried rice and a Tilapia whole fish (curry style) and white wine and lemon tea for drinks. The drinks came quite fast, but for the fried rice we had to wait minimum 40 minutes. During the waiting time, my husband went to the bathroom, which was a complete mess and flooded with water everywhere. Well, 40 minutes later: The fried rice finally came, but - unfortunately- was nearly cold. At least the taste was ok. Nothing special, just ok. Finally and another 15 minutes later the fish arrived at our table. It was a whole fish that looked like a carp, the sauce was more a undefinable Chinese red-chili-sauce than a curry sauce and the vegetables they used as garnish were more or less tasteless. We payed around 125 RM for the food and the drinks, which was - in our opinion - not worth the money. There are much better places to eat in Kuching.

They offered us a table outside but we said we preferred a table inside. We were told that this may take about half an hour.

I hope that I wouldn't miss my footing & end up embarrassingly with wet shoes, etc. Having pass the water test, I was relieve to make it to our table. The upstairs interior reminded me of The Junk Restaurant. We ordered some largers, a hot tea (which seems to be a popular drink here) & a juice.We left the ordering to my cousins & just said the type of food we preferred. The cabbage with scrambled omelet arrived first. This tasted better than I had expected! This was followed by a wet seafood noddle, garlic prawns in a very tasty sauce & sliced duck with buns. The buns looked like they had been fried. The noodle had just the right amount of gravy - not too wet or too dry! The sauce in the noodle tasty good too! And there was a good amount of mixed seafood with it! I was happy just to be licking the delicious sauce that went with the garlic noodle! My only suggestion would be for this dish to be shelled so that I wouldn't have to peel the shell for my partner too (he hates doing this as it takes him a long times to peel it & he hates the mess this involves); this delays my eating too! I usually like to finish off with a desert but was full enough without any deserts available enticing me to indulge further! No mangoes with sticky rice to indulge in! The rest of my table, there were 5 of us in total, shared a good sized portion of the velvet cake. I had a little taster but felt there was too much icing for my taste. My cousin on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed it!They didn't serve any lattes so we left after the single shared desert.The total bill came to about Rm240. This may have seemed fairly expensive to the locals, but converting it into sterling, worked out at approximately £40 for the whole evening!

The menu is varied and based on the reviews from TA we selected the mango duck (small) then took a punt and went for the chilli cashew nut chicken, we each had a bowl of steamed rice to accompany it, my husband had a Heineken and I had a ginger beer. The mango duck comes on Chinese spoons layered with a small piece of crisp lettuce, fresh mango, duck meat, a little sauce and duck skin on top - despite assurances there would be no bones I had 2 small bones in my share (there are 10 spoons in total and a salad in the middle of the plate) this is the only reason I gave 4/5 for the food otherwise it would have been a 5. The chilli chicken was lovely although there was more chilli than chicken. We like hot food and although it was a little like roulette (some chillies were mild others burning hot) overall it was delicious. The chicken dish came with a small salad and a crispy cracker as well as being beautifully presented in an iceberg lettuce leave which also offered welcome relief from some of the hotter chillies.

"GregdundeeMudeford, United Kingdom",Fine Dining Kuching Style,"To be honest, I often review restaurants in Asia as very good or excellent, that in the UK I might not consider to be so great simply because our standards are quite different. However, even by European standards, Bla Bla Bla is a great restaurant with amazing food. The menu offers a varied mix of Asian and European fusion dishes and the portions are HUGE!On our first visit I had the soft shell crabs which were delivered to my table on a plate the size of a car wheel! My second visit I had a lamb dish and on my third visit I had Mongolian deer. Each time we have visited the dish I have chosen has been amazingly tasty, nicely presented and massive! You could easily share one main course between two people. One thing to note, is to be prepared for bones in some of the meat dishes - this is still an Asian restaurant and serving chopped up chunks of lamb still on the bone is perfectly normal here!The vegetarian selection is limited but the quality of the food on offer more than makes up for the lack of choice (although there is still a reasonable choice compared to some places). Again the vegetarian dishes are also very nicely presented and just as massive as the meat dishes.One downside of the restaurant is that it serves sharkfin, which is a delicacy attained through an unnecessarily cruel form of harvest which involves remove the fin from a live shark and throwing it back into the sea to die slowly. Some people will not visit the restaurant because of this, and it is enough to make me not really want to go (I save it for special occasions when family visit us, but would go regularly if they did not serve unethical food). The owners should remove this item from the menu if they wish to encourage Western guests to visit.That aside, the décor is amazing - really beautiful and tranquil. You have to cross a couple of ponds to get to the dining area, and there is a lovely Buddha statue as well as nice plants and nice lighting. The staff are friendly and helpful.

The staff were charming and friendly and happy to advise on food. Most dishes here (even at the smallest size) are intended for sharing, so, having ordered the 'small' soup (2-3 people!) I was very happy when the waiter arrived with an individual portion, explaining he felt the whole dish would be too much as a starter (they charged me 1/3 of the price too!). The main course (cashew prawns) was the only disappointment. Both prawns and sauce were very good, but getting them together took a little work. I'm a big fan of cooking prawns shell-on, but perhaps not with such a rich thick sauce since a lot of the sauce is lost as the shells are removed. The accompanying broccoli and grated carrot felt more like a garnish than something which complemented the dish, but then again, as I mentioned, dishes here are intended for sharing so had I been with three others, we could have mixed and matched dishes and ordered accordingly.

Good variety of drinks but settled for a very nice house Chardonnay. Opted for one of the evening's specials - prawn cooked on sugar cane sticks and vegetables and tofu cooked in a very tasty sauce. Unfortunately the two dishes didn't come together (problems with the kitchen oven?) and I was at first given the wrong main course. Nonetheless both courses were huge and delicious -enough for two people. As compensation for the mix up I was presented with a free dessert - mango brûlée - with my latte. Amazing dessert!

Duck was still available, however they had to keep the pancakes for other tables who had not yet arrived. My husband chose another duck dish, then two meals arrived almost immediately, while my husbands meal arrived almost 15 - 20 minutes later. My meal was a delicious piece of salmon that was absolutely coated in a think horrible creamy sauce, with a side of sweetened mash potato. The entire side if the plate was covered with a local green that had been fried and heavily salted - the entire meal lacked any sort if cohesion - just odd and really sickening to eat.The duck dish when it arrived was average and my son's grilled lamb was just okay.Overall a really disappointing dinner - they appear to be trying too hard when keeping it simple would be a much better approach.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 17 January 2013 ,Bla Bla Bla

Certainly, the locals avoid the place and there were only 2 other tables of 4 on the evening we were there. You can try ordering the midin salad, but all the other dishes weren't exactly tasty. The ostrich rolls on lotus root slices were too tough, while the tofu dishes were typical of a cheaper joint. Worst of all, we had a member of our party leave early. He went to the counter to pay for the two stouts he'd ordered. The restaurant brought 2 more to our table having interpreted our friend's intentions.

"lucyang99Kuching, Malaysia",Simply Food,"This restaurant offers Ceylonese (Sri Lankan), Indian, and local (Malaysian) cuisine. I can't differentiate Indian from Ceylonese food, as listed in the menu. It's according to their preparation/recipe, I was told. So the owner (Damith) patiently identified and explained each item we picked out from the menu. We ordered lamb shank curry (Ceylonese), chicken tikka (Indian), aloo gobi (Indian), plain briyani (Ceylonese), garlic naan (the same for Indian and Ceylonese). For the uninitiated, aloo gobi is cauliflower and potato cooked in onion based gravy. The lamb shank is cooked in santan (coconut milk) with thick onion and garlic paste. I used to think that anything cooked in the tandoor (a cylindrical clay or metal oven with fire built inside for cooking or baking) is tandoori. But I learned from this restaurant that chicken tandoori refers to chicken drumstick cooked in the tandoor, and chicken tikka is chicken white meat (chicken breast) cooked in tandoor. I had the best peppermint chutney (very fine and creamy) to go with the tikka and the lamb. It was most interesting that the briyani was served with a boiled egg in a heavy bowl called katori, made of copper lined with stainless steel. Accordingly, the bowl retains heat and makes the rice consistently warm.

Second time we went there was no Chefs Speciality Fish curry, that's annoying if you're both pescatarians. There was no soft drinks, none, No cans of anything! OK I'll settle for water... There's no cold water! There's a massive fridge which is mostly empty but they don't keep any drinks in it... OK I'll drink warm water then. The rest of the food we had was quite nice. The cheese naan is special and the alu gobi was good, it came in a Masala as opposed to being a dry dish.

malimucanada,Over blown simple ,The restaurant claims necessary to wait for food to arrive at table. True. The lamb shank biriyani came. The shank was room temperature tasteless. B rice arrived separately was so so. Butter chicken so bragged about here was on sweet side. Luke warm basic so was another chicken tika masala i think. Nothing close to tika masala. i guess ok for local or those who have no clue what it sd taste like. Not piping hot as it took some time to arrive and on sweet wide i guess locals like sweet. The hot chai tea came after lot of pomp and show of the maker barely warm to not worth a sip.only worth the dish was cheese naan. Rest for a very savy foodie this was a so so place. good for locals as kuching does not have much of indian cuisine as we know. No offence.

The menu is somewhat limited, basically a few North Indian curries and a few Sri Lankan curries with about 6 varieties of naan. The prices are reasonable. I had a Sri Lanka vegetable curry and garlic naan, the serving size of both generous. The curry I found to be somewhat bland but the naan was excellent. I was there early in the evening with only one other table and the service was quick if somewhat indifferent. The speed of the service indicated the curry was precooked, in fact the curry was served about 5 minutes before the obviously freshly cooked naan.

iisechewMalaysia,Nothing goes wrong that garlicky PESTO on the handmade pizza,"Balkanico Pizza is, to me, hands down, the most authentic hand-made pizza in Kuching.Our pizzaiolo (fancy word for pizza-maker hehe) who goes by the name of Aleksander hails all the way from Montenegro, Southeast Europe. I love how Aleksander makes the dough from scratch, kneading the dough with strength - it comes out from the oven as a perfect thin crunchy crust. Fresh from the oven, the pizza is amazing- from the texture, to the cheese used, and the freshness of the ingredients, it's a culinary heaven for the tongue. The greatest highlight to me is the home-made pesto sauce - this blended green basil mixture complements the pizza perfectly! This pesto has such a strong garlicky taste, it simply made the pizza stand out immediately. He makes the pesto with freshest ingredients daily. If you are a lover of garlic and strong spices, you can't miss this pizza with its pesto. It's too good. In my life, I've never had pizza with a stronger garlic tang. For those who aren't really fans of garlic however, you could always request for lesser or no pesto at all.

Quite thin and did not taste much after rice flour. Tomato sauce with hint of garlic was also nice. Guy was nice. setting was really nice. Pizza place is actually just oven with few tables with ingredients and to prepare pizza. It is situated on terrase to Big Bottle bar/pub. Big Bottle is self service place. you grab beers or wines from fridges, put ice into bucket and grab glasses. You can stay inside where it's ACed or outside, where is quite nice in the evening, especially after few cold sips of beer. Atmosphere was really nice, festive/celebratory like.Now the bad: BE PREPARED - pizza does not taste like italian or european stuff. Ground beef was ok, pepperoni did not taste much - too dry, not after paprika, and they put some kind of hot dog/wiener prolly made of some chicken parts. no good at all. Thought it did not taste rich, my wife got puffy mounth - sign of MSG getting it' way into pizza (possibly in meat products or maybe in tomato sauce). Which is unfortunate.We had some 'fusion' pizza with nonstandard ingredients, but they were made to work.We really wanted to like this place and come again, but there is no reason to risk it. It took me week to even write this review. And gave it 3 points, cause we liked everything else beside pizza there. Otherwise 1point would be too much.So be prepared, consider not getting Balcanico pizza (one with meal sausage) and only just one pizza to boot, to see if you like it.

But, the curry flavour was awesome with added fresh lime juice! It also came with prawns and a generous portion of beansprouts and lean chicken pieces. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy. The rice was also fluffy and soft. The stir-fried mixed vegetables was not overcooked but the gravy was too thick and sweet.

TrushnaP7,Beautiful views ruined by cats everywhere,"This restaurant really HAD potential. Good location by the Kuching Waterfront and nice place to cool off and have a drink as you watch the sunset. Unfortunately, these simple pleasures were ruined during my last trip to the restaurant. Felt unwelcomed from the get go by a waitress who told us to go sit 'anywhere'. She pranced off uninterested and we were then attended to by male waiters (hats off to them for their kind service and deepest condolences for having a brat as a colleague). Wish I had good things to say from this point forward but nothing got better. There was a litter of kittens in the restaurant, jumping on tables and rubbing on customer's legs. The wait staff would shoo the kittens off when we complained but the waiters were also playing with the kittens. How unsanitary!

I found the service reasonably OK drinks were ordered and arrived faily promptly however having said that meals all arrived at different times. I had fish and chiops as I had had it on previous visits but was a little dissapointed, it seemed barely cooked on the inside but almost burned on the out and the coating was very salty. My wife and young son though had the Kuching curry Laksa and both reported that it was delicious. My elder son had mixed vegatable which he also reported as ""very good"" The meals all came at different times so it was a bit odd eating seperately together for our first family meal in Kuching for 14 years. The toilet fascilities left something to the imagination and you had to go outside to the back to find the toilet I use the public toilet as these always seem very clean along the waterfront. I remember from our past visits that beer used to come in frozen tankards but on this trip I did not see any evicence of this. James Brooke's is not a cheap place to eat but I think if you go with the more local type dishes you will get a better quality meal. We did go back agian for another meal and I tried a different fish dish, White raja grilled fish, which again wasn't as good as the local dishes that the rest of the family ate.

natashag7799,That's not authentic kuching laksa!!,"(Am malaysian, but from Sabah, never been to kuching before - but there is kuching laksa in Sabah)Based on the good reviews, i decided to just eat there ( and accept paying the higher price), since i didn't see any other 'local-looking' coffee shop visible from the riverfront walkway. I was sooo dissapointed!! It's so frustrating to be starving ( and the wait for was pretty long) and just not be able to eat much.The main problem was the soup ( or broth) was waaaay to sweet. And it tasted like the sweet peanut sauce that is used over ""rojak"" or served with 'sate' NOT kuching laksa.So i picked out and ate the chicken, and some of the beans and green leafy veg ( also not the typical veg served with kuching laksa - it's normally bean ) , ate some of the boiled egg ( also it's meant to be thin omelette style, sliced up like ribbons)... then left the rest. The only plus was the serving size ( which may warrant the price) but that's useless if you can't eat it.(In desperation i later bought myself a happy meal from a mc donalds i spotted)Show less",2.0,Reviewed 24 March 2018 ,James Brooke Bistro
Clay W,Nice ambience and good food,"Firstly, the price point is reasonable given that the restaurant is located at Riverfront Kuching. Thus, it has a nice and relaxing ambience. We had ordered a Sarawak Laksa and a Butter Cream Chicken. The food portion is huge. They did not hesitate in putting the fillings of the food onto their plates.The Sarawak Laksa is full of flavour and most importantly the spicy level is mild which did not overpower the dish. Moreover, the Butter Cream Chicken is delicious. The cream sauce contains full of flavour and it is buttery but not overpowering. The one delicious component of the dish is the shredded yet crunchy thing in the dish. It brings a sweet and salty savoury to the dish. We also ordered a Banana Fritters. It was delicious as well. The fried banana combined with a rose-flavoured ice-cream, it was heaven.However, the restaurant should hire more staff to serve the guests. It was frustrating especially during the peak dinner hour. In addition, they should install more fans as it is quite humid and there are mosquitos around the restaurant.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 22 March 2018 ,James Brooke Bistro

As long as one gets the drinks fast it’s ok to deal with. The location is excellent and the ambiance even better. The vibe could improve though because the character of the restaurant lends itself to that. To only put fittings and fixtures is not enough.

We weren't particularly hungry but needed to eat so just ordered sandwiches each.

We had read some poor reviews about the service but the service we received was very good. Absolutely no complaints here from us. My personal criticism would be the toilet.

"lucyang99Kuching, Malaysia",A vantage point,"You go to James Brooke Bistro at Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman, on the Kuching Esplanade, to enjoy the scenery at the water front and beyond. The food is nothing to shout about. But for the price you pay, you can't expect too much. I've been there for brunch, lunch, dinner, and afternoon snacks. The Bistro offers a very pleasant atmosphere. I like the bistro's open set up, three sides open up to the waterfront walk way, overlooking shrubs, trees, Sarawak River, and the Malay Village the other side of the river. The river is a hub of activities with roofed motor/paddle boats called tambang (local Malay language) plying passengers back and forth. And the waterfront walk is alive with these exchanges of commuters and people who take a leisurely stroll. But don't miss out one of the most beautiful sight to catch. Right on the Bistro's frontage, facing the river, is a family of nine bronze/copper sculptured cats. I'd say they're life size, that of average local cats. The sculpture captures these felines' antics, frolicking on the grass and up a stump. A very life like sculpture!Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman is the road against the back of the Bistro. It's one of Kuching's busiest thoroughfares. Along the street and its adjacent streets are lined with luxury hotels, boutique hotels, budget hotels, shopping complexes, travel agents, money changers, eateries, shops and more shops than your eyes can take. After ""studying"" the Bistro's menu and no food item tempts you to eat anything, just order a drink. Then take your time to watch the world go by. Or if you've just been re-charged, take a tambang to cross the river and breathe in the vibrant Malay kampung air.

"jvhKuching_MalaysiaKuching, Malaysia",Hardly appetising,"As expats living in Kuching for over 5 years, we have eaten at James Brooke many times. It used to be a favourite when we first arrived and when friends come to visit. Admittedly, we hadn't been for a while before last weekend, but also doubt we will be going back in a hurry. It is true that the location on Kuching's waterfront is good. If all you are after is a cold beer, then perhaps that is OK, but we found that the quality of the food has gone downhill - majorly. As with many times previously, I had Mee Mamak (local noodle dish). At first, I was surprised that they had managed to bring it out so quickly, but I soon realised that it must have been because it was not fresh. Tasted dry and not at all like what the dish should be like - paying 3-4 times what a good local cafe may charge, I was feeling slightly disappointed. However, it was my daughter's meal that was truly shocking. Whilst we know that Malaysian attempts at Western cuisine can sometimes be a bit questionable (no disrespect), we were surprised to find that her order of butter chicken was, in fact, a serve of their special 'Brooke' (or Rajah?) family recipe chicken (specially coated like KFC), a totalky separate dish on their menu, with MELTED BUTTER on top! OK, so butter chicken may not have western origins, but this was by no means what we had expected for one of the most expensive meals on their menu. Drinks served up in cracked and dirty glasses only topped off our memorable experience! Replacement glass was also filthy. I know I sound harsh, but this used to be quite a good establishment and without the feedback they won't improve. On the positive side, my wife reports that the laksa was OK (still 3-4 times local cafe prices) and the staff were polite.

It is open to the elements some make sure you get one of the many fans positioned towards your table. We decided to have a light dinner and drinks and watch the sunset.They have quite a variety of laksas on the menu, traditional and non-trad. I ordered the traditional Sarawak laksa which I found acceptable but my companion ordered one of the ""creative"" ones; a Jame Brooke special or suchlike. He found it to be an odd combination of flavours, as did i. rather like a strange tomato soup. Anyway I would stick to the traditional offerings and it is fine. Staff are pleasant but have a rather relaxed attitude to service. It took a very long time for our drinks to come and then the food. They were nowhere to be seen when we wanted to pay so had to go to the counter to rustle them up. Prices were on the higher side but you have to expect it in that location, so not too bad.

To top it off someone else emerged from the back, another waitress or management perhaps and she was TWEEZING her eyebrows on the restaurant floor! Yes, I'm not one to be fussed about average service but this is meant to better than average and yet their staff are completely demotivated. I paid with a 50 and I was given 31MYR in 1 ringgit notes.

The eggs were tasty, but the advertised butter is margarine, and the lightly cooked tomato was dripping in an unidentifiable oil that was greasy and stale. The first meal was the Sarawak laksa, which was tasty enough for a western palate but the noodles took over the plate leaving very little room for the gravy which was a shame. As for service, for a place obviously wanting to attract tourists, it was atrocious. The first day I had to ask to be served and even so the young man finished with his cellphone before doing so. The young woman seems to need training in how to be a waitress at all for she is either meek and frightened or just completely unaware. The (owner?) came in and in front of diners disciplined the waitress which resulted in a whole cake being thrown out - it seemed it had been there too long, validating other reviewers comments regarding staleness.

It is the nicest spot I have found directly on the tourist area of the Kuching River to chill out, especially on the Verandah style terrace.Located in the small park in front of the little Chinese Temple next to the Hilton, it is now a must visit for me every time I pass through Kuching.

"Sawasdee1Lofthouse, United Kingdom",Disappointed (-:,"Was looking forward to eating at this restaurant on our first night in Kuching having read mostly great TA reviews. The restaurant is in a good setting close to the river... Internal decor is kinda cool with asian antiques, buddha statues etc..... However, for me anyway, both the food and service were not what I expected. Starter of spring rolls was ok but garlic bread looked and tasted stale... Ordered green curry for main course which was way more watery than normal with a strange hint of sourness, fatty chicken and a mush of vegetables... Seems to me that the sauce was made with mostly water and nit coconut milk... Really disappointed as I love to eat good, tasty, hot and fresh food.. This just wasn't. Service was very slow for some reason although plenty of staff around and only a handful of tables to take care of... Would I give it another try? No..

Monday night was particularly busy along the waterfront with lots of local people and market stalls etc yet Tues was almost silent and all closed up. Just worth mentioning just in case this is the norm on a Tues?!Also would recommend jumping on a river taxi over to the Mira Cake stalls on the other side of the water. The river taxi is only 1MYR each way (approx 20p) and the cake shops are vibrant and very, very tasty!! I bought a Mira cake 10MYR and it's beautiful!

Having checked into our hotel we set off in search of breakfast. This bistro is in pole position on the waterfront, consequently would be chosen by many like us with little or no knowledge of Kuching eateries.My advice would be to walk past this place and find another. People generally in Malaysia are charming and here they were pleasant, but were not very accommodating, eggs on the menu were only available as fried despite them being offered in various styles. One of us ordered boiled eggs these when they arrived had barely been warmed, with little or no white, a health hazard potentially, speaking of which, whilst we were waiting for our food we were watching a rather weird looking cat who then proceeded to catch a rat and was running around showing everyone his trophy and finally running into the kitchen to show the chef. The staff were most amused, the girls letting out little screams.. On the plus side the one type of coffee offered was pleasant.

From then on it was our standby option for lunch - mainly a bowl of laksa and an ice cold beer - and for several evening meals - nasi goreng or curry. The food was very pleasant and although a little more expensive than other cafes in Kuching was far better value than eating in the hotel. Most of the other diners were European, Australian or US tourists, probably from the nearby major hotels. The atmosphere was very pleasant, with a colonial feel and a great view of the waterfront. Service was friendly and reasonably efficient. Overall, an excellent place to spend an hour or so as evening falls, or as a midday break from the heat. One evening we were trapped in the bistro by torrential rain, but watching the storm over the river while enjoying an additional beer or so was a great experience in its own right.

Some minutes later, our main courses arrived at the table and I said that I had yet to receive my first course, to which the waiter could not offer an explanation.

The other negative thing is that there were about three-four cats in the restaurant. Some were on the tables.

"Peter DTeddington, United Kingdom",James Brooke – for a quiet riverside stop,"One of the nicest places in Kuching for a drink or a meal is the James Brooke, which stands in its own grounds on the city’s riverside esplanade. Named after one of Sarawak’s ‘white rajahs’, it boasts a pleasant open-air verandah area, and the tables throughout the restaurant are spaced out enough to give you a decent amount of privacy. Although music plays in the background, it’s not intrusive – and the overall quietness of the place is one of its attractions.During our stay, we stopped off at the James Brooke most evenings for a drink or three. The food looked tempting too – but we didn’t eat there because, oddly, the restaurant didn’t accept credit cards.

Sounds crazy but actually haven’t started on the food yet. The food Just had the most amazing salad calamari Mango salad and it was amazing. “Try it you won’t be disappointed”. Warning the portion is huge. This was followed by the salmon steak although swopped the salad for mushrooms. This was amazing the sauce just made it. Will be back before I leave. Thank you.

"Alvin NKuching, Malaysia",Dining in a museum,"The Junk Restaurant has been around for a while and it has taken its time to carefully craft a reputation among Kuching's boutique restaurants for fine western dining with a local twist. For all its name, the ambience is not quite a junk shop but a museum. Old pieces of antiques and curiosities are laid out tastefully on this 2 level restaurant housed in a traditional Chinese shophouse.Anyone born in the last century (i.e. 1999 downwards) will connect with the many time pieces that the restaurant collect - from classic made-in-Hong Kong metal toys (I spotted a red fire truck that I had as a child) to art decor, from Dayak gongs to Chinese lanterns there is a piece of memorabilia there that shouts to the nostalgic past. One might as well dine inside a museum. Food-wise, the food has always been satisfactory - not out of this world but good enough for a cozy gathering of friends or a formal dinner setting for 10. Fusion is the word but the fare is not pretentious. One can enjoy a good steak alongside the signature Midin salad served Thai style. My favourite is the salmon steak with its generous helping of sauteed onions, mashed spuds and greens. I'm not much of a drinker but Junk carries a decent range of foreign beers chiefly Erdinger and Foster. Service however can be erratic. I have had excellent as well as bland attention from the staff. Guess it has to do with new and experienced personnel. Location wise, Junk is centrally placed (at Greenhill, one of downtown Kuching's party zones) but parking can be a challenge because it is located alongside a few other well known F&B outlets.

"marcok834Den Bosch, The Netherlands","Food ok, service terrible.","We ate here last night, and ordered the spaghetti and the organic chicken. After a few minutes the spaghetti was served. The waiter leaned over the far end of the table ( belly flat on the table. Big table, short waiter..) and handed me the plate. I looked surprised because of this strange way of serving and then he realized it was maybe a beter idea, to walk around the table. Then it took 15 minutes for my partners food to arrive. Lucky for me the spaghetti was really hot, so I could wait slowly while waiting for the chicken. I must say the Red housewine was really tasty. During dinner they grab your plate before you have swallowed the last bite. But when we wanted to ask for the Bill, it took 10 minutes before they noticed us again. The food was ok, nothing special and certainly not worth the high recomendations given on T.A. This was the first time the rating here really let us down.

"Dax5335Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia",Very eclectic ,"Cool spot, feels like multiple houses opened up into each other. Every table made differently, and the decor is a Mish mash of all sorts of cultures and tastes, though heavily influenced by Chinese.Good food, we had a family of four dining, and so I was able to try a little of each dish. The food was not high end at all, in fact we found it to be rather ordinary. It was good, we did feel like we got our money's worth, but it was not special. The portions are fairly big, more than our kids could eat. The cook was great at preparation, nothing was overcooked at all. We tried the cod fish, fish and chips, baked prawn, and the salmon gnocchi. Some neat ideas, and good flavours but rather ordinary overall. Still great for Borneo though!!!!! We live in Malaysia, and in our city it can be very hard to find good food. It's not the best in Kuching, but it's good for the price, and worth seeing the eclectic environs.Enjoy!Show less",4.0,Reviewed 12 November 2015 ,The Junk

"485yincKota Kinabalu, Malaysia","Food was good, service not so much.","The thing about good experiences in restaurants is that, often times, the food does not matter. The food is what brings people to the table, but it's the service and ambiance that makes the experience memorable. The Junk gets some, but not all of these things right. I'll quickly run down what they've done right, before I touch on what they could do better.The ambiance and atmosphere is well presented. With several distinct areas for eating and even a bar in the back. Having been seated in the upper floor, it was a clear a lot of thought went into decorating the place with old timey pieces on the walls that reflect a certain aesthetic. I wouldn't go so far as to call it junk, but oldish perhaps. Not in a bad way. The place pleasing to the eye, and not in any way distracting.The menu is an interesting mix of Western and Asian. Personally, we ordered the Angel Hair Prawn Pasta and the Salmon Gnocchi. For drinks it was a Longan & Lychee Ice Tea, I think? Along with a Tuak Mojito. The food and drink were great in terms of portion as it's big. At 30 or so Ringgit for each plate I was pleased with how much I was getting, as well as the taste. The drinks were served in fairly tall glasses and were rather generous with whatever they were tossing inside, be it the longans and lychees in the tea, or the mint leaves in the mojito.Now as for the service. We weren't immediately asked if we were looking for a table upon entry to the premises. Not a big deal in the bar section, a bit of a deal in the restaurant side of it. I don't mind wandering aimlessly finding a seat if there are plenty of tables, but when the tables are occupied, I do think it would be good to have someone quickly try to seat a party as soon as possible. Next up, the ordering process. Not the most difficult bit, really all one needs to do is be able to pay close attention to what is being ordered, and repeat the order again just in case we miss anything. No drama there, I was happy with how that went down while I was there.The placement of cutlery was standard, drinks arriving on time was good. When things went mildly awry was the arrival of the food when one dish arrived significantly early than the other. Not entirely sure if it's because the place only has one section of the kitchen dedicated to cooking pasta and we made the mistake of ordering two, but it does seem a bit peculiar to have one pasta dish arrive first, watch as several other tables start getting their food on the table as well, begin to wonder if the other dish will ever arrive, get around to flagging a waiter to check on the dish just before it makes it's way to our table.But yes, otherwise food was good. Basically cleaned up the plates of all signs that there was food on it once it was on the table because we were that hungry. As the waitress was clearing our table of the plates we asked for the bill and she acknowledged. See where I come from, an acknowledgement typically means that something will happen. Whether they get the bill to us or inform us that we can pay downstairs. Something has to happen. Except nothing did. We watched as other tables were cleared and we finished the rest of our drinks before flagging one last waitress for the bill before were told that yes, we can actually pay downstairs. So downstairs we trotted, looking for a pay counter that I wasn't aware was hidden away inside the kitchen? We asked one more fellow where to pay for our bill before we finally get to have that settled in the tiny corridor between the dining and bar area. It is a bit unorthodox, and I'm not sure is the norm in terms of their service, but I do find it amusing that I basically had to speak to 3 different waiters/waitresses just to pay my bill. I probably could, and arguably should, have started walking out when it takes several tries to pay for a bill that no one seems interested handling.In brief summary, I liked the food and drink in terms of both quality and quantity, the decor does ooze old timey junky charm. The service gets some things right, but they need to time the food right so it isn't an absurd wait for everyone to get their food, and there is a need to have our bill when asked the first time, not the third time.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 9 November 2015 ,The Junk

"Alsek810Chapel Hill, North Carolina","I wouldn't know how the food was, it never arrived.","We went to this restaurant after reading positive reviews on Tripadvisor and some restaurant blogs. We were seated upstairs and our orders for drinks and dinner chaoices were taken promptly, About 10-15 minutes later one drink arrived, followed 5 minutes later by the other drink and my dinner companions entree. We then sat at least 20 minutes , with me telling her to go ahead and start eating, while waiting for my entree which was a grilled fish dish. The waiter who took our order was no where to be seen so I flagged a waitress and explained I was still waiting for my entree, no results. After 40 minutes or so after ordering I finally walked downstairs to the kitchen and found our waiter and canceled my order. Sort of unbelievable especially when people all around us were ordering and being served. Made for a very dismal dining experience. When I asked for the bill for the drinks and one entree that was delivered we were told we did not owe anything. I appreciate they did the right thing. However the service was unexcusable for a dining establishment with this reputation.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 6 April 2015 ,The Junk

545johne,Stylish eclectic eatery and bar ,"This labyrinthine restaurant seems to go on and on, from room to room, as you make your way through narrow corridors like you're in a virtual reality role playing game. It's almost surreal. The visual impact the place makes is its best point in my opinion. The deeper in you go, the more amazing the ambiance becomes. I wish I'd known that before sitting in the first room offered, upper left front. The bar on the ground level on the other side of the central open kitchen is amazing. An interior designer's wet dream, with dozens of Chinese lanterns and disco balls hanging from the ceiling, fountains, funky furniture, industrial objects d'art, full grown trees, an atrium, fully stocked bar and God knows what else. Yet at the same time functional and comfortable enough. We had digestifs after our meal and watched the party crowd arrive around 10.30. Would like to have stayed longer but had an early flight to catch. There is a nice outside garden area out back as well! The service was generally okay at the dinner and the prices not outrageous, considering the portion size. OMG. The plates are enormous. Sixteen inches (40 cm) across or more! The chicken wing starter was a meal in itself. The bruschetta was like a whole baguette sliced sideways with whole cherry tomatoes on top and it was delicious. The wings were not bad either. Unfortunately the waiter didn't inform us that the roast chicken main dish was basically the same recipe as the wings, both covered in an attractive deep red, but overly sweet BBQ sauce. It was disappointing similar to the stuffed wings and the roast chicken, (a whole bird), was somewhat rubbery. By that point we had had too much chicken and ended up leaving some of it. The cod in crab sauce was a more modest offering size wise but likewise the sauce overpowered the fish. All in all though, quite edible and good value. The beers were cheap, especially the Guinness and Tiger drafts, but the house wine was expensive and served in miserly measures. Would definitely go back again, now I know the ropes. Lots of PLU there and everyone seems to be having a good time. KL clubs could learn a thing or two, decor wise. Show less",5.0,Reviewed 28 March 2015 ,The Junk

Anne L,The Junk,"Read one of the reviews here and was astonished as apparently The Junk's backstage bar is perceived as a ""gay bar"" well, that is not the case just because you see a few flamboyant characters here and there. EDM is mainly played over at the backstage bar usually around 10 pm where patrons come and flock over for a good night out for dancing and drinking so if you're thinking of dancing to Lady Gaga, I'm sorry better luck some where else however if you're into karaoke you can walk pass by the pizza kitchen and enter, ""The Red Room"". The front bar of The Junk is next to The Red Room, and it's a nice little bar to socialize with the locals without having to speak over loud music which is always a plus and also, a little exploring around the restaurant wouldn't hurt as there's antiques to see and admire.There are wide ranges of alcoholic beverages served here and some are rather pricey in comparison to other bars that you may find around Kuching.Food is good here especially the Lamb Shank and I always find myself coming back for more however service has gone terribly awful as the years have gone by.

Of course Kuching is a fairly cheap place to eat, so a bill of £400 for 30 or so people including drinks was good value.

Flyer099WashingtonDC,"good place for a ""Western"" night out of dancing and drinking","A few friends and I went to Junk after dinner because we heard it was a good spot for drinks. I know people talk about this place as a restaurant as well, but we did not have any food here, nor was food being served when we got here around 10PM or so.I will say that this is a pretty modern bar. They had cocktails and drinks that are not out of place at home in Washington, D.C., including my favorite drink of theirs, Hoegaarden and ginger beer. When you go to these smaller sized towns in Asia, it's hard to get more modern drinks besides just the local beer -- Junk definitely provides a more upscale and trendy location to drink. The clientele there seemed trendy, and the book told us that ""peninsular celebrities"" go here.I also think that this place doubles as a gay bar. I don't know if that is some underground secret (oops) or something relatively known, but there is definitely a good portion of gay people here. The place was pretty packed as the night went on, and so we really noticed how small the actual bar is. This is just something random, but I'm not used to people smoking in bars, since that's outlawed where I live. I was not a fan of reeking like cigarette smoke when I left here. It's just a hazard of the trade, I guess. I don't know if it's because I am not Malaysian, but I did not know many of the songs that were played here -- it was heavy on techno remixes of unknown songs. My friend recommended a Lady Gaga song, and the DJ responded, ""We don't play R&B."" Um...ok...?Overall, Junk is a pretty good place to have a fun night out.

The bar downstairs again had pretty funky decor and quite a hip feel. The staff in this place I felt let it down. The two waitresses in the restaurant sat chatting to each other at a table outside for at least 40 minutes and ignoring customers. No chance of another drink or desert if you wanted on.

"Judy MSydney, Australia",Truly terrible,"Some off the food was - just - okay but definitely not worth anything like the RM30-40 for most dishes. The garlic bread was good. The lemongrass chicken was ridiculously strongly flavoured but its accompanying salad was nice. The roast chicken came smothered in a nasty red sauce and any flavour in the vegetables was drowned in oil and pepper. Annoyingly, the menu described it only as 'organic roast chicken' and that was what the server repeated when asked - no mention of the sauce or oily vegetables.Service was beyond hopeless. We were told to go upstairs then ignored for 15 minutes. We were finally given a menu then ignored again. It was early and there were only 2 tables with people and plenty of staff - there's no excuse. Twenty minutes later we were asked to move to make space for a large group. I said I'd rather not as I didn't want to leave our nice, bright table near the window to move to the very dark, dingy rear part of the restaurant. There was quite obviously plenty of space to fit the large group without us being tossed out of our pleasant spot. Multiple staff nagged at us until we gave us and moved. The back of the restaurant is just nasty and the forced move - no apology - was beyond disappointing. What was worse was that when we left the tables had been rearranged and another family (not the big group which still hadn't arrived) was sitting at our original table. re the atmosphere, yes, the stuff that's all over as decoration is interesting to look at (unless you've been shoved into the back corner where they seem to have only out the leftovers) but it's also in desperate need of a good dust and polish. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with the experience and I would never recommend Junk.

There are narrow walkways and corridors, steep wooden unstable stairways and the place is decorated by antique junk of all sorts.However the cooking from the smallish kitchen hits you and the helpful and friendly staff go out of their way to cater to you - seating can be on the ground floor (very limited) upstairs in the front, or backstage around the back.

We were very impressed - the décor is amazing, easily the most unique restaurant of this type I have ever been in. The walls are lined with various trinkets, pieces of art, antiques and much more (even a real antique dentist chair!). We now live in Kuching and go there regularly.The restaurant is a bit of a maze, but I actually mean that as a compliment, as navigating through the various rooms is interesting thanks to all the 'junk' you encounter. The entire premises seems to occupy at least two or maybe three shophouses, although its hard to figure it out exactly. There are several dining areas, a front café/bar area and a really cool bar/club in the back called Backstage. The Backstage bar features my favourite of the decorations from the entire place (red Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling along with a chandelier). There is a pool table, although this is often moved or covered for functions or when its time to party. There is a DJ in on Friday and Saturday nights and the place really gets busy as the evening gets later.The food at the junk is the real star - all of the massive portions are worth a go - the best of the bunch for me being the cod fish in crab meat sauce and the red wine duck. There are two vegetarian options (for main course) which are vege lasagne and vege pizza. My girlfriend almost always gets the vege lasagne and loves it!The Junk also does the best bruschetta in the world, with fresh sweet cherry tomatoes.The service can sometimes be a bit slow on nights when the restaurant or bar are busy, but I would recommend you just relax and enjoy the wait because the food is worth it.

I do not say this lightly. It wasn't merely inconvenient, ""a bit busy"" or ""part of the atmosphere"". It was so deeply disorganized, disinterested and rude that it left us, and the diners at the tables around us, looking at each other, from table to table, in complete disbelief.We arrived at around 8pm. Strangely there were no staff to show us to our seats. We made efforts to get the attention of passing staff for 5 minutes but they had no interest at all in showing us to our seats and seemed to deliberately ignore us. We had to venture as far as the kitchen and physically block a waiter's path before we were acknowledged and grudgingly shown to a nearby table.Menus followed 10 minutes later. Having made our choice, vigorous waving for some 15 minutes secured us a rushed 20-second slot with the busy staff to place our order.Our earlier trip to the kitchen proved to be one that had to berepeated on no less than three occasions throughout the night. The staff were unwilling to make eye contact or respond to our requests to deliver our drinks, which arrived 40 minutes after the first main course.We were not alone. A steady stream of customers seemed to make their way to the kitchen, in search of their waiter, the chef, the manager, someone, anyone, who'd be willing to deliver their food or even let them pay the bill. One poor man stood there for a few minutes and after numerous staff had walked past him he gave up hope and placed a pile of notes under a nearby bottle of kitchen spray. I doubt it included a tip.The food was ok but basically very average and didn't even come close for making up for the service.I understand that restaurants can be busy (even on a Sunday night).

"Leelaw000Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Worst recommendation from a friend,"When a friend recommends you a restaurant, you go without hesitation - because, well, your friend has dined there and liked it. So I went straight into The Junk (just behind my hotel) without checking the prices. To be honest, I don't think I even noticed if there was a menu stand outside the restaurant. Anyway, on my way in, the cheese cake counter caught my attention (as they always do), and I saw this: RM12.20 for a piece of cheese cake. Fine, maybe it's homemade cheese cake, not some mass produced stuff. Fine.When I sat down and checked out the menu, I was shocked at literally all the prices - from drinks to steak to pasta. You don't expect to pay RM35++ for pasta at a place like this - no scenic view, no elegantly dressed waiters, no romantic lights. I did actually debate as to whether I should head out of the restaurant, but you know, mild pride issues prevailed.So I ordered the cheapest food on the menu - fish and chips (RM20), and free water. Then the fish arrived and I realised soon after that I couldn't cut into the sides of the fish. I mean, the plate was gigantic, the chips were abundant - but the fish! The fish fillet's sides were so hard / stale / over-fried that I had to cut it with the strength utilised when cutting into a medium steak. I would not recommend it to ANYONE at all for two simple reasons:1) Food overpriced for its mediocre quality2) James Brooke Bistro & Cafe, a cosy, well-menued eatery with scenic view of the river, is less than 5 minutes walk away of The JunkShow less",1.0,Reviewed 29 November 2012 ,The Junk

"AlexGalfvensjoStockholm, Sweden","Bad service, bad drinks, expensive","We had read so many good things about this place, and really looked forward to coming here. Once we actually did, all four of us were very let down. The waiter was really rude. We ordered 4 drinks and 2 slices of cake. They forgot about the entire order, so I had to walk down to remind them. When we finally got the (qutie expensive) drinks, they served the mojito without soda (therefore flat). Before we had finished the cakes and the drinks, we were actually asked to leave because they closed. This despite the fact that we had waited 30 minutes for our drinks! It would have been nice to give us at least 20 minutes to finnish them (instead of a total of 10 minutes). I'm usually not one to complain, but this was bad.I hope that we just had the bad fortune of visiting on a bad night, and that the place usually is friendlier.

"Romain1136493New York City, New York",Overpriced and terrible service,"Place to avoid. Food is average, overpriced and the service is terrible.We went there yesterday. First, the price is easily two times higher than other comparable places in K. For that price we were expecting a good service and nice food.Truth of the matter is we ordered chicken and a pizza. After 10 minutes my chicken comes but not the pizza of my wife. 15 min later the waitress said we would have to wait a lot for the pizza as there was a group who ordered many. Question: why with such high prices order does not come at once? My wife order the chicken and waitress said she is sorry. Meanwhile is chicken is getting cold. We saw many chicken dishes served in front of us (priority you know what it means?), ordered french fries to wait, insisting it was because of her mistake. Her chicken comes finaly, almost one hour after mine. It was very very average.They made us pay for the french fries and gave us nothing for ruining our dinner ! Incredible ! Most expensive place we have been in borneo and yet the poorest service! Next time we will consider a food court. No glamour name or waitress but no lies in service quality.

mistyh81London,"Consistently TERRIBLE service, lucky the food is great","It is such a shame that the service is so bad at this place as it really stops us fully enjoying ourselves and often I feel loathe to go here. But...it is some of the best Western food you can get in Kuching, so you really have no choice when wanting to eat Western.The bad:1. When you enter the place there is noone to greet you or tell you where to go (it is a bit of a maze with many rooms). You have to beg to ask a passing staff where you are meant to sit and if they feel like stopping to help you they will, otherwise they just shrug and keep walking.2. The staff can't handle the volume of people and orders. I ordered a red wine, 10 mins later they brought me a white wine so I asked for them to bring the correct wine and was told I would have to wait 15 minutes as they were busy!!3. If they are busy, the staff treat you as though you are a nuisance and you feel bad asking for anything.4. Once we sat with our dirty plates in front of us for 25 minutes. We wanted dessert, but noone would come to see us and check we were ok and when I tried to flag someone down I was ignored. I gave up BEGGING to give them my business and we went to Secret Recipe where the cakes are just as amazing, so its a good tip for anyone wanting dessert but are getting nowhere trying to order it at The Junk.5. Sometimes it get overrun with children. It is popular with families. Try go after 9pm when they families leave as the kids running around the place (with is usual and fine for local places here but you wouldn't expect in a more upmarket place) ruin the vibe.The good:1. THE FOOD! Love the food, it is the only reason we come back here time and time again after being treated so badly by the staff. The chips are delicious, the pizzas have the nice thin crust and the meat is very nice. The portions are big, we recommend sharing2. The decor. We are always so impressed with how ""forward thinking"" the decor is for Kuching. Red lanterns, soft lighting, curios everywhere.This place could be a real gem if only the staff weren't such a let down. We eat here about once every 10 days and we would come more often if only the staff weren't so bad, as we don't enjoy our ""experience"" here, only the ""food"".Show less",3.0,Reviewed 7 September 2012 ,The Junk
"kakiayamEdinburgh, United Kingdom",Love the bar but service is a hit and miss,"Been a few times as I just love sitting at the back of the restaurant, which is the bar. The section of the bar is decorated with lots of red lanterns which gives the place a nice lighting. There are various local artefacts that mainly featured Borneo. There is a pool table which is in the centre of the room; surrounded with tables and chairs. We ordered our food and drinks with this lovely superfriendly waitress; and settled onto our seats. About 15 minutes later, a huge group came and sat at the table just a stone throw away from us.Sometime later, we saw a waiter carrying a pizza that we had ordered, coming our way. We were so excited as we were hungry and thought it was ours. But, oh no wait! The pizza went to that group table. Hang on! We ordered first and they got it first. Its just plain not fair. We complained to the waiter; and the waiter was giving us a lame excuse saying that they ordered first. But we said that we ordered before they did. He just went blank and went away. No apologies. Nothing. Not very happy with such an attitude. It was just a huge contrast of service between this waiter and the waitress that took our orders.Another 10minutes later, another pizza came along. We held our breath and thinking which table it was going to be served at. We got lucky - finally!To sum it up - good bar, good food but service could have been better.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 6 September 2012 ,The Junk
-aquamaryn-,"Like the food, hate the service..!","Went there for a quiet dinner out with family to celebrate. In with high spirits, left on a low. Never got the menu until 10-15 minutes later, after many attempts to ask for one. Ordering was even worse- they never came to take the orders even after one of us asked for a waiter, one of whom was at a station writing something. All we got was a curt ""Wait a minute"", and needless to say, we waited ages before we ordered anything- worse still, that waiter never even came to serve us. With orders done, we thought that the dinner would proceed smoothly, but we ended up with a missing dish- only one of 2 identical fish dishes arrived, leaving one of us without dinner for nearly 45 minutes. Hungry and irritated, the night was basically ruined. On the upside, the steak was great, but the other meals were poorly done. Roasted chicken was too dry, albeit saved by the tasty sauce, and the lamb was a tad too salty.

"jenbatesPerth, Australia",Great atmosphere and service,"I ate at the Junk twice during my stay in kuching. I went early 7:30 pm on Sunday and opted for the chef's special which was Duck and Mango salad. I also ordered a glass of red wine and garlic bread as I was ravenous and thought the food may take a while as the restaurant looked busy. The waiter kindly offered to bring me two slices of bread (instead of 6) and I was charged pro rata.The meal came quickly and I was very impressed with the efficient friendly waiters. The salad was amazing- rare slices of duck breast, crisp salad, generous amount of mango and some secret ingredient like a gremolata and fine dust - ginger and ??? Well I will never know because chef said it was a secret ; ) I went downstairs for a quiet drink. Enjoyed the music and atmosphere very much. Great experience. Went back Wednesday night a bit later - at 9pm it was very crowded and noisy. Didn't appreciate 5 children running around the pool table. Had another salad. It was poorly presented and over dressed/seasoned. Waiter explained that it was a very busy night. But I would definitely go back.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 30 July 2012 ,The Junk
hismenteaKuching,I had high hopes because of it's reputation but...,"Well, I guess I now know why someone came up with the phrase 'Don't hold your breath'.The service was just okay. To say that it was super fantastic, then no, I'm sorry, but it wasn't.I liked the whole dark atmosphere, because it felt cosy. The only problem, for me, was that it was just way too crowded. No, not with people; it was crowded with, literally, junk. The place is already small enough; did they have to make it even worse by filling the place up with junk?I went with my family and friends, and our food took about forever and a day to arrive, and when it did, it was terribly disappointing. My lamb shank looked about the same size as my (then) skinny kitten's leg. I thought that maybe mine was the only small one, but it wasn't; my dad's and my friend's had skinny lamb shanks, too. I've had lamb elsewhere, and theirs were so much bigger, and so much more tender. The one in The Junk, though, was just so... blah. My mum's risotto looked so yummy, but tasted weird. My sister's dish, though, was humongous. What, fisherman's friend? Something like that. Anyway, I thought that it was worth the price, until I realised that it was only just topped with seafood, on top of a mountain of french fries, like sprinkles. When I realised that, I wanted to laugh, so loud, but I controlled myself. Needless to say, I don't think the food was worth it at all. Based on the prices, I expected it to, at least, taste good, but it didn't. If you're going to serve food like this, at least price it UNDER RM20, because that's all it's worth.And did I mention I hate the surroundings? The placement of JUNK throughout the place? Yeah, the place is called Junk, but you don't literally have to live up to the name and make it hard for everyone to find their footing when they walk around. Horrible!NOTE : One last thing; I know this only happened to me, but bear in mind that this could also happen to you.I had an iPod Touch, and I brought it with me to dinner here. After dinner, I accidentally left it at the table. I came back within five minute of leaving the place, when I realised that I'd misplaced my iPod. When I went back to my table, I talked to this one waiter, and asked him if he saw my iPod. He said that he didn't, and that he was the one who cleared the table. He looked extremely nervous, was fidgety, and was making a huge show that he didn't see it. He started pulling out chairs, looking under place mats, and almost got down to his knees to prove that it wasn't there. If the lighting had been better, I knew he'd have been sweating bullets. He even told me to search the trash can, because that's where HE threw whatever from the table when he cleaned up, and not long after he said that, he ran away from me as fast as he could. I can read people very well, and I tend to notice facial tics. The waiter? Guilty and nervous, he was trying to hide something. He tried to mislead me into thinking it was in one place, when, really, it was with him. I hate that, but I let him have my iPod. I can't do anything to him, so instead I'll just let the guilt literally kill him slowly, over time.Suffice to say, this place was terrible. I don't see why most everyone loves this place. It's overpriced, the food is disgusting and not even filling(even though we have to pay through our teeth for it), the employees are bloody dishonest and the place is way too littered with, I can't stress this enough, JUNK!

"HMac30Central Hungary, Hungary",Disappointing Dessert,"After having a fantastic dinner at Top Spot we went to The Junk for dessert. Upon arriving at 10pm they told us the kitchen was closed and no more coffee, tea, or cocktails were available. This we found surprising seeing as the restaurant itself is open until midnight and everyone eats late in Kuching. We asked if we could still have dessert and one waiter said yes. Then another came by and said no. Then we had to go and get the initial waiter (this should have been our first clue to just leave). We ordered Kailua cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. Both looked good but they were far from delicious. They even took off the little chocolate ball that sits atop the piece of cake and we had to ask to have it. However the chocolate wasn't even good.

"HalfWomanHalfSharkKuching, Malaysia",Make sure you're hungry...,"...because Junk's portions are big! Prices may seem a bit steep on first glance but you'll realise why when your food arrives. Their Western menu is good and has a vaguely Italian focus, and service is reliable (they are also flexible about tweaking dishes when the restaurant isn't busy). However, for food you can probably get better stuff at Junk's sister restaurants Living Room and Bla Bla Bla just down the road - their menus have a mix of Western and Asian dishes (try the wonderful homemade tofu or midin salad - midin is a local fern). One advantage of Junk is that it has a late-night bar, Backstage, attached, so there's no rush to head home after you've stuffed your face :) The quirky decor and teeny tiny chairs are fun (though try to bag a sofa if you're staying for more than one), and table service is provided at quieter times.

If you are looking for a great pizza, you won't fing it here. I don't like ""cracker-crust"" style pizza, but what bothered me most was the fact that the pie was swimming with oil and lacking in taste.

Each dish came with a green salad , mashed yams and our meat. Both of them were very good, tender and much flavor. The portions were generous. So much so that we did not have room for dessert.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative comments since we did not have a good experience here. Firstly the lighting is so dim we could hardly read the menu and despite asking twice for the candle on the table to be lit it was ignored by the staff. This meant that when the food arrived it was impossible to see if it was actually cooked properly. I ordered the chicken and it had a suspicious pink colour which I had to just hope was from the seasoning and not undercooked.Secondly the service was poor. We very hungry when we arrived so ordered bruchetta to share as a starter, but after a long wait this was served at the same time as the main courses. We observed a similar situation at a neighbouring table where a caeser salad was served as a starter instead of a main course. The menu did have a good range of choices and the portion sizes were large, possibly too large. But the prices were far higher than justified by this. It was one of the most expensive meals we had in Malaysia and probably the one that gave us least pleasure.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 30 July 2011 ,The Junk

I believe that it's more of sentimental reason that the repeat customers flock there. Choon Hui has been around, and is in the same venue for as long as I can remember. It operates in an old two-storey house, with very limited number of parking space. So, many customers' vehicles are parked illegally by the road, along the heavy traffic Ban Hock Road. Choon Hui is right at the busy intersection of Ban Hock Road and Song Thian Cheok Road. Besides being known for Sarawak laksa, it was known for its charcoal toasted bread with kaya (coconut milk-egg yolk custard spread). Regretably, they now use electric bread toaster. The operators and the servers are friendly, polite, and always cheerful in treating their customers. Price is very reasonable. I can't remember when Choon Hui is not crowded. So, it's always cramped and hot. Expect your food to be quite slow in coming. Very often, you have to stand and patiently wait for an empty table. Is it really worth eating there? Ask any die heart! What else is there besides laksa and toast? Go there and be surprised. I only say all the food is food. Try not to go later than 11 o'clock. By then, most of the food is gone.

We understand that because there we're so much people. However, I won't ho there anymore Due to a lady worker there scolded us for being sitting at a BIG table. We arrived really early at 7pm, and there is lot of people. No table at all. Some people were chatting at their SMALL table after finish eating. We waited... We did not got for a VERY BIG table. We knew there was people with big groups. So, there is a family of 5people. They let out their table after they dine. We just ssat down. The table can sat for around 6 people. My friends ask the lady worker to clean for the table and she just took away SOME PLATES and never came back to us. After I ordered the food, it made me really disappointed. She was cleaning the other table in front of us. The people using that table had just gone for a short while. We asked her to clean for our table too. She seem reluctant to clean for us. OK, fine... Then she asked if we had ordered our food and we said we did. She had no choice but to clean for us and asked us how many of us.. I said 3...she then scolded us that we should leave the table as there were many people needed the BIG table. We should use the small table instead. We said there were no others table at that time. She just replied that we should wait for longer to find the SMALL one. We looked around and there we're really no small table available. Only the BIGGER ones. I am really Disappointed!!

"Vincent MNew Orleans, Louisiana",Outstanding Twice Over,"Ling Loong Seafood is located outside, standing on the roof of a car park, in the Top Spot Food Courts. There are awnings overhead, but the breeze from the river leaves you in now doubt that Ling Loong is out, standing. It's food is outstanding too.I hadn't been eating much and tonight is my last night in Kuchin, so I decided to splurge. Found the building easily; from across the street look for the roof that's got an awning and colored lights, including green light near the edge. I ordered small portions of Grill Prawn with Butter and Garlic, Black Pepper Mussel, Ginger Clam with Kuyong, Miding (Jungle Fern), and Rice. The small dish of prawn were five of the largest, meatiest prawn I've ever had (though oddly enough they had something even bigger on the menu listed as Jumbo Prawn). The very large mussels paired very well with the black pepper sauce, while the very tiny and delicate clams paired equally well with the slivered ginger. The small shellfish orders = 100 grams, so it doesn't really matter whether the shellfish are big or small--you'll get the same weight either way. However, being curious and waiting for the check anyway, I counted the clams. I knew there had been an awful lot of them. Turned out there had been exactly six dozen; 72. The jungle fern was delicious, and the rice was great flavored with the various sauces. Best seafood dinner I've ever had in Asia, and I've had some memorable ones. The tab for all this was 61 ringgit--almost exactly US$20. A 2/3 liter bottle of Tiger will set you back 17 ringgit, not bad for Malaysia. It came with a mug. (The mug had been recently washed and there was still a tsp of water at the bottom, so I drank from the bottle. Call it an excess of caution.)

AhmengSingapore,Average,"I find the food in Ling Loong Seafood average. Maybe our expectations were too high, after reading all the positive reviews in tripadvisor. A lesson of managing your expectations, I suppose. We ordered omelette with oysters (or better known as ""or-lua""), butter prawns, stir fried vegetables and sambal stingray. The vegetables and stingray were okay, not bad. The omelette was very different from those you find in Singapore. Not quite appealing to our taste buds. The butter prawns were not fresh. We were initially prepared to eat there more than once but we didn't go back after our first meal. Nonetheless, the place is quite crowded with locals and tourists. Perhaps, the dishes we ordered didn't do them justice. Or it was just a bad day at work for the chefs.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 7 October 2014 ,Top Spot Ling Loong Seafood No.6 & 33

bSpearUK,Incredible seafood,"Directed here by our homestay owner and Lonely Planet, we were really not sure what to expect. I was expecting the more market end of the fish market it had been described to me as, but it turned out to be much more open-air Cafe/restaurant. Prices were reasonable for excellent fish (800g sea-bass was 32RM/£6 and 7 large prawns 18RM) and tasty veg (fried fern, 8RM?). Would highly, highly recommend for easily the best piece of fish I have, and probably will ever have, had in a restaurant. We chose to keep the fish quite plain - opting just for sambal. Still getting used to the shrimp paste (v fishy) sambal, we were a bit taken aback when the fish came out slathered in enough sambal for 4 people to share. Luckily it wasn't cooked in the sambal and it came off easily enough. Maybe ask for sambal on the side, if you're not sure!Lovely atmosphere with a lot of locals (midweek too). Quite an airy location atop the car park (rid yourself of any dingey, grotty car park roofs you might have in mind - this was very clean with a swanky looking cocktail Bar sharing the roof...) but lacking in a great view.Plus side it's very easy to find - you're looking for 'TopSpot' and when they say look for the lobster sign, I think they mean the bright red neon one on top of the building!Show less",5.0,Reviewed 13 October 2013 ,Top Spot Ling Loong Seafood No.6 & 33

iisechewMalaysia,Proudly Sarawakian Fine Dining,"ROOTS bistronomy @ Kuching Old CourthouseOur dinner date here was exquisite. We’ve been here a couple of times, and have always ordered their specialty ‘Paella’. The heart of the cuisine here is how they incorporate spices from its ‘roots’. Proud of their Sarawakian heritage, the fusion cuisine served here truly is exquisite.  The Paella here isn’t your typical ‘wet’ Spanish Paella. Bario Rice with garlic aioli, Indian Saffron, Sarawak Black Pepper, Chilli flakes with various herbs are baked to perfection. Crispy at the edges, the vegetarian Paella has never failed to deliver its goodness. Fresh lemon for squeezing is provided, giving it the optional zesty punch.  The wild mushroom soup was most unique and delicious. The emphasis here is on the usage of wild mushrooms and the ‘Kulim’ fruit, a garlicky herb giving the mushroom soup a whole new angle. It was lovely. Since we were on a budget, these 2 dishes sufficed, and it was well worth it.  I love how quite a number of Sarawakian cafes place a strong emphasis on their roots.

The presentation and service were excellent, I found it great to try such high end food in a casual and relaxing but beautiful setting. To be honest I think I have avoided this type of dining before as I have not felt comfortable in the environment. I can recommend the Snapper fish, served with a stunning sauce, the Soft Shell Crab was also fantastic. If you are looking for a new experience, maybe something different and a bit special, give it a try, I will definitely go again. The staff were supportive and I even got to meet the chef who came out to see what we thought of our food! One issue was it was difficult to find parking as it was busy, however the lady in charge advised, had I requested this could have been made available.

On first impression, it looked like a biker's dream come true with an array of motorcycle memorabilia and collectibles. My companion and i settled to ordering our drinks and dinner- ABC ( shaven ice with red beans , and grassjelly) , and upon the waitress recommendation, a fried tomato kuey teow and their specialty, their ox-tail assam pedas ( oxtail in a sweet sour hot stew) . The latter sounded quite exciting and we were eager to try . The desert drink ABC came first - it wasn't too bad with a right level of sweetness but I would have preferred if the ice were more finely shaven.Next was the tomato kuey teow- the prawns and squid in it were fresh and firm but there were only 2 prawns - I would have expected more for the price of RM14! The kuey teow tasted a bit stale , evidencing that they were probably kept in the fridge for at least a day or 2. The success of every tomato kuey teow lies in its fragrant tomato ketchup gravy and I could actually say that this particular gravy here was quite pleasant with the right amount of ""kick"" of sourness and sweetness.......... but that is where my compliment ends. The oxtail assam pedas was a huge disappointment!!! Not only were there chunks of bones and little else save for 3 very stringy old and "" unchewable"" lady fingers and a few pieces of sliced tomatoes , but when I pointed it out to the waitress that I had nothing but bones in my dish she went to the kitchen and came out a few seconds later , shrugging her shoulders and said - "" sorry but the oxtail is ""memang"" like this."".For a hefty price of RM28, I would have expected at least 50% meat and 50% oxtail bone, but what I got was probably 5% meat and 95% oxtail bone!!!I really felt cheated here!

These were nice and the mushroom sauce that accompanied them was tasty but again, I was served mashed potato instead of fries and my vegetables were cold too. My son didn't fancy anything from the main dishes but had the chicken wings and garlic muscles. The chicken was well cooked and the muscles were nice but also had cheese on top and they were cooked in an enormous amount of garlic.

Joanna S,New café in town...,"My family and I decided to have lunch at this new place after it caught my eye during its renovation process as well as hearsay from friends. We ordered the Meat platter, lamb chop, red snapper and seafood pasta with chinese wine. FOOD: all the meat dishes didn't disappoint. Except for the steak from the meat platter. We requested for medium but it came out medium-well with certain parts still rare. Flavour-wise, it was tasty and I liked how it was grilled well with that charcoal taste. Serving portion was large enough to fulfil our hunger. PASTA: a need for improvement on its tastiness and serving portion. Not generous enough with the seafood nor parmesan cheese to give that extra kick. SERVICE: another area to improve. The service staff are not observant. For eg, the customers' glasses of water are empty, pls don't wait for them to wave just to get refills. By right, eyes should be on the dining area to ascertain that any requests by the customers are met. And there was the occasional mistake of serving the wrong item to our table.PRICE: Reasonable for the food (except for the pasta which is not worth it in my opinion) but pricey on the drinks as most dining establishments are nowadays.CONCLUSION: I'll still go back for the food and ambience. Hopefully, the management will improve on the service and the wellness of their steaks. Take some tips from places like Australia, NZ or Japan. Even Singapore has better quality of service.

The pork soup was great too and the vegetable dishes were prepared perfectly. The only comments I have is that they ran out of 2 of the 3 kinds of rice on the menu (how can a restaurant run out of rice???) and that they only put the tuak wine to be chilled after we ordered it, so basically we had to drink the whole bottle at room temperature.All in all, the place looked much nicer under the previous ownership but the food is more delicious now, under the new ownership.

For durian fans, tempoyak sauteed with anchovy or pork belly is an appetizer and goes perfectly with plain steamed or boiled rice. Dayak, phonetically pronounced d'yak because the first letter ""a"" is not pronounced as strongly as the second letter ""a"", is a general term now used to refer to any of the indigenous, ethnic groups of Sarawak.

The food itself was alright - somewhere between real longhouse and restaurant cooking, although the portions were relatively small. A highlight was the babi panggang - really excellent grilled pork.

realfatfreddy,Experimental menu,"While there are scattered exposure to native ""Dayak"" cuisine, this is one of the few in a restaurant setting. Its hard to say which community is represented in the menu but the main point is that it reflects the native community as a whole as different from Chinese or Malay. Note that this is a halal restaurant. While the dishes are distinct in taste, I consider some of it as still evolving from home cook to a restaurant quality meal. For example the chicken in bamboo has evolved to a soupy dish which is very interesting and tasty. The service is decent, location is good, decor nice and I think a place to go for a change for business guests.

EdisonLeeSingapore,I'll be back...,"I have read quite a bit about the.Dyak since 2014 and finally brought my friends there while on a fishing trip one year later. Being aware of the cultural influence behind this eatery, I had specially made plans in the itinerary so my friends could try something different other than the usual Kuching trip.The first thing that took my breath away was the pictures on the wall. I had stayed at a Longhouse when I was still a student on a geography trip so not only were they a familiar sight, it brought back fond memories of my school trip more than 20 years ago. The atmosphere - while not out in the forest - was sufficient to remind us, we are really here for Iban food.I have to admit, I can't remember all the names of the dishes because I was so busy trying each of them. My favourite gotta be the roast pork and not always we get served with such tender roast pork. The rice wine sure came in handy for a wonderful dinner with friends, especially on a cold and wet night.The exception was a reservation ""glitch"", thankfully, the restaurant wasn't full. I had 7 pax with me so if it was full, it will be a very embarrassing delay. Auntie Mary made it up with exceptional service. She is such a friendly host and owing to a rather empty night (because there was a super heavy downpour), she took time to go through the menu with us.I will certainly be back (with all my fishing friends) everytime I am in Kuching.

"SMBMPHSao Miguel, Portugal",Interesting and tasty ,"We visited as a family for dinner following impressive lonely planet review. The ambience and decor of the restaurant are lovely. We were lucky to get a table as it was about 20.10 and last orders are 20.30.The menu is, as reviewed by others, authentic local cuisine and we chose the chef specials including fish, chicken and the pork. Our daughter is 8 and not a fan of spice so really the only thing on the menu she would eat was the pork - she liked it with the rice. Our son (11) is more adventurous and tried all the dishes. Everything was very tasty and different to most asian cuisine we have tried before so was a nice experience.Our only criticism was the lack of drinks choice. There is only rice wine or bottles of heineken. The rice wine actually did compliment the food but is not our normal taste. The lady in charge was the relative of much of the historical pieces which was very interesting and she was keen to find out if we have enjoyed the food.Overall we had a nice experience and a nice meal however it probably isn't the ideal choice for a family who have children with limited tastes.

"PanguinSingapore, Singapore",Needs a consultant,"This restaurant has got potential.Consider--bringing jungle fare to visitors in an era when people are going organic. But the restaurant does not quite pull it off.The place aims for an upscale fine dining experience. The owner tells you that his grandma, from whom the recipes are derived, was a Dayak princess. And he has photos to show.The food is served on fine china. The wine is premium rice wine. And of course it is expensive.Fine dining, however, is not just about food or drink. It's the whole experience.The first thing I saw when I got off my taxi was a couple of chairs placed on the parking lot in front of the restaurant. Which was puzzling because there were plenty of lots available. If I were the owner, I would not park in the lots because I want my customers to park there. So I could not understand why the chairs were there to block off the parking.I went at about 7 pm and there was just a couple there.I went in and when I sat down, I was presented with the menu. I had to wave a couple of times to get the waitress's attention. And I had to ask about the food. There was no tasting menu. (Why not? If I'm new, I would like to try a bunch of things.) So I said--you have many interesting things I want to try. Can I order half?Answer: No. ""We can serve half but the price is the same."" So the food will be wasted?I ordered the pickled/fermented durian, a fern vegetable (not midin because Ibans do not cook them), pork, chicken and had the ice cream with rice wine dessert. I was full. There was enough food so I could have had someone else join me.The rice was very good and overall I felt that I had a healthy meal. I left at 8 pm (last order is 8.30 pm) and in that time, only one more couple was there. So that's five of us for dinner.The owner did come by to chat. But he was dressed very casually in shirt and shorts. For a fine dining outfit, the entire staff should be dressed in native finery.Quite clearly the expensive meal was not bringing in locals. That leaves the visitors. But the way the dinner is packaged, it does not encourage sampling and trying out. A tasting menu with a long list but small portions would be attractive.The place has potential but needs a turnaround so that more than five people are there for dinner.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 1 May 2015 ,The.Dyak
tunatoniteKuching,"Second visit, still not much improvement","This was my second visit, after more than 3 years. First impression was not good (they charged for extra plates back in the day) and upon suggestion of the owner, I decided to revisit this establishment for reevaluation. And I brought my wife for independent opinion. This was an unplanned trip as I want to see if the owners means what they say in response to my first review, which they reported to Tripadvisor as inaccurate.Went there after work on a weekday and the place was pretty dark and warm from the afternoon sun. Read about the day's special and tried to order some umai, but was told they ran out of umai after lunch hour, so we were left with no choice but to order some of the other fares on the menu. Seeing that the menu portions are for 2pax, we ordered 2 veg and 1 grilled meat (refer pic).I have taken Dayak dishes quite often and I find that the fare here is nothing to talk about, as well as miserable amounts for the price they charge.Environment? When they finally turned on the lights and the air-conditioning, then you will feel a bit more comfortable and start to check out the various exhibits. The laminated brochure about these exhibits was a nice touch. Playing of Christian songs in the restaurant is not really a good idea, and traditional instruments may be preferred for the mood. How about some sape music, eh?They don't charge service charge, but encourage you to tip. But you hardly see waiters except the moments when they come to deliver something to your table. And the price of dining is already 2-3x more than what I think it's worth. And just a handwritten receipt without pricing/GST information.Personally, I don't think this place warrants another visit.

It seemed really odd to me that such a policy is enforced. I do hope that this is looked into by the restaurant management, as I think the service leave much to be desired.The food of which we ordered the tilapia with local aubergines in a broth (this was alright), the stewed pork in a soya sauce was excellent, the paku pakis had a strangely rancid taste-perhaps it is an acquired taste, and finally there was the chicken in bamboo which was rather tasty.For a sum total of rm110, I would say it is reasonably priced, but like I said above the service was appalling..Show less",2.0,Reviewed 30 December 2014 ,The.Dyak

"sudskumSemporna, Malaysia",Decent Italian food in Kuching,"I went to Bella Italia a few days ago for a quiet dinner. The setting is very Italian as you step into the restaurant and seems to be a mixed crowd of people from couples to friends and family as well. With a full house it does get noisy so probably not the most romantic setting for couples. The menu here is extensive and has many varieties of food for lunch and dinner. As such the food quality could be compromised. We didn't try their specials for the evening but we ordered the bruschetta for our appetiser; from the pasta list, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio and the Pollo pizza as our main course. The bruschetta was a little dry and the bread was a bit hard with the vegetables seemed to be a little overcooked. The pasta however was really good, the oysters & prawns were fresh and succulent. The pizza was not seasoned properly and needed some extra pepper and sauce for my tastebuds but this is subjective and relative from one person to another. Otherwise service was prompt and the food didn't take long to prepare, makes you wonder though if most of the bases and dishes are pre-prepared hence why they are lacking in a distinctive Italian taste. They could do better and make it worth the prices they are charging which in my opinion is in the above moderately price range.

Service is a huge disappointment, waitress was not helpful, no host in site but seemingly dismissive waitress stormed over. Everyone say you have to get used to it when you visit restaurants in Kuching. Restaurants i have been to those waiters will usually ask the guests ""how is everything"" right after they take their first few bites. Nothing like that happen here.We had mushroom soup and garlic bread before main dishes were served. The mushroom soup is amazing especially the freshly baked garlic bread! We then had Hawaiian pizza, nothing outstanding which i think was pretty standard, as for ingredients, Pizza Hut is better. I would love to try Pinocchio pizza next time. Risotto Pollo is a huge disappointment... all i could taste was peppers, overcooked rice and more peppers. Spaghetti Con Cozze is the highlight! Mussels are fresh and perfectly cooked, i just love dishes that come with asparagus.

"GregdundeeMudeford, United Kingdom",Inconsistent but sometimes good,"We were pretty giddy with excitement when we discovered there was a proper Italian restaurant in Kuching (well outside of Kuching, near the airport). However, our first experience of Bella Italia was not very good at all. I had a pizza with tuna and anchovies (I forget the name of it) and my girlfriend had a vegetarian pizza - both of these were takeaway.When we got home I found my pizza almost entirely lacking in anchovies, leaving me with an unseasoned and very bland tinned tuna pizza. My girlfriend's pizza had some odd ingredients on it (cauliflower on a pizza?) and had a vague and suspicious whiff of fish about it.We had made up our minds not to try Bella Italia again.However, some months later we were in that area for some reason and decided to try them again but for lunch this time. We sat outside which is actually quite nice - like a little sidewalk café in Europe. I had the Pinocchio pizza which was absolutely delicious - one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. My girlfriend had a vegetarian spaghetti dish with chillies, olives and garlic which was again very nice (she opted for this as after our previous experience she did not want to spend too much on a pizza, only to be disappointed). Because of this visit we were raving to all of our friends to try Bella Italia.A couple of months ago we were at a party at Four Points hotel, just around the corner from Bella Italia. After the party we decided to go and have some food. There were four of us adults and two kids - price wise it was pretty good, RM160 for six people isn't bad at all.The food that time was mostly good - I had the Pinocchio again which was good but not as good as my previous one. My sister in law had a chicken salad which was not good at all - the chicken was dry and looked a bit like a wrinkled up finger, and the tomatoes were nasty. My brother thought I had over-hyped the food and on this occasion I had to agree with him.So it is very hard to review this restaurant as anything other than hit and miss as so far out of three meals our food has been bad, then good, then average.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 24 August 2013 ,Bella Italia

There's no decoration inside-out of the cafe, atmosphere is boring and no unique feel, but the service is outstanding.

However, if you want a private room, kindly reserve it as sometimes the rooms will be taken. Food is delicious but I will not recommend here due to the price here.

It was dark and warm and everybody was hungry!! After the power came back, we waited almost an hour for the first dish to be served. Total waiting time was 1.5hours The Peking duck was a real disappointment. The duck skin wasn't tasty nor crispy. The local fern dish midin was great except for the hard ginger juliennes they garnished on top. Stir fried lamb was quite tasty but there were more bones than meat. Other dishes were OK but nothing to shout about...The biggest disappointment was when I asked for the bill, I was given a lump sum.

weirdguyBandar Seri Begawan,Why bother to offer Dimsum that you couldn't even serve decent delicious Dimsum? We feelin' cheated!,"My wife and I decided to re-live the great moments when we last visited the restaurant about 8-10 years ago. We weren't married by then - just great friends and soulmates, having our great-ever Dimsum Buffet around noon. We could remembered very well. The food was super great and the service was impeccable. Till today, the Dimsum of that moment was still the best.However, the Dimsum of today (trying to re-live moment) was super duper disappointing. Given the high price, very confusing limited choice of Dimsum Menu (About 5 items only) and terribly not delicious, it was literally our worst dimsum dining ever. We think the Food Court or Hawker Center have way way better Dimsum in terms of taste and offering than this Restaurant.-Outrageous Limited Choice of Dimsum. It stroke me why the Restaurant even bother to offer Dimsum at all.-The SiewMai tasted 'jelly', 'chickenball' - not fresh meat and definitely not freshly made. While for HaGao, you can barely taste the prawn and the freshness of the prawn at all. And, the worst of all, their Chicken ChaSiew Pao. The filling was terribly and unacceptably little. When you cut half the Pao, the filling could be seen as a fine red line.I simply do not understand. You are a Fine Dining Chinese Restaurant - Why offer Dimsum if you couldn't serve a decent delicious Dimsum? Be warned that they don't even serve Chicken Cheong Fun.Beside the food, the restaurant looked worn-out when we entered. The table, we seated, need certain physical push/adjustment for 'total balance'. The staff assisted my wife on the adjustment after she seated. It was an awkward moment and from the way the Staff acted, it seems this is a norm. If we were not mistaken, there seems to be no apology for such awkward moment.On the positive side, we enjoy the view of the Waterfront in the cool air-conditioned environment. The Chinese Tea served was alright and also, my Wife really enjoyed the fresh-squeezed Orange Juice. We even joke the Orange Juice was the most delicious, tasty, up to the Fine Dining Standard, comparing to all our ordered Dimsum dishes and even the Chinese Tea.Also, the Restaurant Manager On-Duty did checked on us briefly. It was a quick question, mainly on our orders only. No conversation, not even gathering our feedback about the food or our satisfaction.If you asked me, No - We wouldn't return. We kinda feel that we had been cheated that such a Fine Dining Chinese Restaurant serving such worst and cheap Dimsum. It was not just limited choice, but also it wasn't delicious at all. Albeit the expensive price.Show less",1.0,Reviewed 25 August 2016 ,Toh Yuen

At about 1pm, the selection of dim sum was very limited with only about 5-6 types to choose from. The selection of other dishes like chicken, fish, etc was good.

"GladysyeoKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",The last dish which never came:),"For dinner the other night (18/5/2013), my family and i visited Toh Yuen. The restaurant was 1/4 full. Seated and it took quite a while for a waitress to take our order. Our dishes were simple. For the 4 of us, we ordered vegetable, chicken, prawn and tofu. 20 minutes later our first dish of stir fried vegetable came. After a while, I asked a waitress where our rice was and again, the ""In a minute"" sign. The rest of the dishes, not to be seen. We had to wait (again) for the second and third dish to be served which took around 20 minutes each. Each course took around 20 minutes to be be served. The other groups which ordered later than us got their food and a lot more by that time. Sensing that our last dish which hasn't arrived yet ,so we called the waitress again and told her that we have waited for a long time and we would like to leave- if the dish is not there within five minutes, we would need to leave. ""Ok, ok can you wait five minutes? Let me check with the kitchen"". We agreed and let the waitress do her job. She came back to inform that the dish indeed has not been prepared and asked if we would like to cancel our order. So cancel we did. There was lack of staff that night. One waitress taking order and another one busy whole night CARVING DUCKS. The only commendable waiter was a guy which i presume works as a pool boy during the day as he was wearing a pair of shorts and sports shoes. How bizarre.When we left the restaurant, we noted that were functions going on in the hotel and probably that was the reason for the hiccups and holdups at Toh Yuen.

We made reservations (it was a Friday night and thought it was necessary). The place was pretty packed that night as there was a big group having a birthday gathering too.For appetiser, we had the Caesar Salad Bacon (recommended by the wait staff) and Pork Meatballs. The salad was fit to feed 5-6 pax, it was pretty tasty but nothing fantastic. The meatballs were dry and definitely not recommended.For the mains, 5 of us shared 4 dishes. 1. Grilled smoked pork chop with apple sauce - It did have the smokey smell but taste wise it was definitely not smoky enough for our liking.2. Lamb shank - a very small portion of shank for the paid price. A bit on the dried out side and definitely not worth the value.3. Roast Lamb with red wine sauce - this is from their ""Today's Special"". This was pretty good.4. Gnocchi - Not the best in Kuching.The meat dishes came with a choice of starch which were either french fries, potato gratin or roesti. I would recommend the gratin as the roesti had a weird texture. Overall, I can say for Kuching standard the food is pretty decent but I believe some of the dishes are priced too high and not value worth.

It is clearly not easy to reach the place as it is located in a relatively new area of Kuching, Sarawak, definitely far from the city center.The good part of it is that you have a large space to park your car right in front of the restaurant.It consists of two areas: a dining room and a bar/lounge. The place is not too big but nicely furnished and decorated.We were greeted by one of the owners that quickly introduced us to the menu and the variety of Swiss inspired dishes (the chef, the other owner, was born and trained in Switzerland).We ordered Potatoes & Leek Soup, Chicken Cordon Bleu with Potatoes Rösti, Grilled Belly Pork Ribs with Apple Sauce, Stuffed Roasted Pork Belly with Red Wine Sauce and Grilled Red Snapper with Parsley Sauce.The soup was smooth and creamy and the Cordon Bleu was lovely, with cheese nicely melted. The pork ribs were having the right amount of fat and the combination of the pork belly with its sauce was just right.We wanted to cut it short but we were tempted by the chef's description of his signature dessert: a trio including Chocolate Brandy Mousse, Almond Parfait and Mango Sorbet... we couldn't resist!Right after the first bite into it was clear that we were having the privilege to sample a masterpiece from a multi awarded pastry chef and seasoned Chocolatier (we got to try his home made truffle chocolate as well).The flavor combination of the dessert was shadowing the already lovely dinner, a definitely must try in our opinion if you have the chance to visit this place.A special mention for the service, always prompt and attentive, and for the nice time spent listening to some of the stories that the chef decided to share right at our table, from his long worldwide culinary experienced.When the bill came we hardly believed that all the goodness was costing only RM230.00!It was a shame that we had to bump into this place only on the last day of our stay in Malaysia, but rest assured that we will be back as soon as possible.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 3 June 2016 ,Razzmatazz Bistro & Bar

I went there for a late diner during the week and it was just lovely to sit outside at a big table on the pavement. Staff was very nice and honest. I ordered 4 Satay skewer and a dish called pumpkin special, which was a bit above average price compared to the other dishes. The waitress told me, that it might be too much for one person and although they could have made some money with it, they recommended to take something else. So I took a pineapple chicken, which was cheaper but also very delicious! I got a whole pineapple, filled with chicken and pineapple strips in a creamy coconut sauce and a bowl of rice. Portion was big enough to fill my stomach, after a long day in the Semenggoh National Park, having nothing but a few crisps and 3 liters of water all day. I ordered 2 iced Nescafes, which was great together with this dish and relaxed while following some 80's songs on the screens inside.

How many Filipino Restaurants can you name (outside the Philippines)?As a generalization; there is a very good reason for the lack of any international standing in Filipino Restaurants.So,it was with great trepidation that I visited the Pinoy Fiesta Ihaw Ihaw in Kuching, Sarawak.Thankfully I was very pleasantly surprised. The menu was well presented and offered an extensive selection of the usual Filipino fare.I chose the Pineapple Chicken and was stunned to see it delivered in a hollowed-out pineapple. The presentation was very appealing and the meal was remarkably delicious. My partner ordered the Sisig, which I sampled and it too was extraordinarily tasty.

The Kolo Mee is fantastic! I had the version with everything (tripe, tongue, other offal). The noodles were flavorful, and their bao (big Chinese dumplings) are also delicious. They close after 2pm I think, so you have to go in the morning or at lunchtime. It's definitely worth it for a local experience in the Main Bazaar. When I travel, I prefer to eat at places that feel local and less touristy (yet that are still welcoming to everyone), and Kim Joo had the ambiance I was looking for.

"Wayne KKuching, Malaysia","Not too bad, not overly good...","Grew up in Kuching my entire life and never tasted kolo mee from this shop before until recently, when I heard from many how popular it was, I decided to give it a try last weekend. There are few types of kolo mee, namely the straight noodles and the curly noodles. I prefer curly noodles which is usually what you get at most of the places in Kuching. This shop seems to serve only the straight noodles but I did not mind trying. I ordered the normal kolo mee with char siew, which was slightly more expensive than other local stalls. There were only a few pieces of char siew on top and it looks rather plain. The taste is not that bad though. However, this place does not have the ""red"" char siew oil but they only have chili sauce to make the noodles red if you want it. I ordered another mixed soup plus noodles for my parents. The soup has quite a lot of ingredients but for that price, it should. The soup however, tasted rather plain which may be healthy. It tasted of bean sprouts only to me. Overall, the mee is not bad if you can't find any other kolo mee stalls around but it's definitely not one that I will crave for. You can still try it though. Taste is very subjective. :) Oh, the people there were friendly though. Thumbs up for their good service. It's a family run business.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 23 April 2015 ,Kim Joo

kelapangKuching,Good Food. Best Music in Town,"I start by confessing that I have done a fair bit of crawling in Kuching City on Borneo Island. And if you have time for just one night out in Kuching, you would not go wrong by choosing to go to 21 Bistro located at the 21st Alley of Padungan Road, Kuching City. They have a good selection of Western and Asian dishes. Their side dishes and tit-bits are excellent too which would go well with their extensive drinks selection. But what makes 21 Bistro stand out is the music. They have a very talented acoustic group playing various popular tunes. In other cities, such musical talent would be found in high-end exclusive establishments. 21 Bistro brought these talented musicians together to entertain patrons typically made up of after-office professionals, music lovers, walk-ins, the occasional cigar-smoking aristocrats. Refreshing to have a place for the best authentic music right here in Kuching amidst the trend for cafes with loud, manufactured music.

I must agree with another reviewer that having 3 or 4 waitresses sharing the job of keeping track of 4 people's orders and servings gets a little distracting.

Lively atmosphere.Cons: small beer Rm 14. 'Happy hour' meant 1 ringgit less off the price of your drink...However the main reason I've given this place an average instead of very good is the hassle off the waiting staff... As soon as we had less than a third of our drinks left we were repeatedly asked (by three different waiting staff in the space of 10 minutes) if we wanted another drink. In the end it felt like being hassled by a sales assistant... Not good!!! I don't know whether its pressure from management to boost individual 'sales' but it got annoying when the same thing happened on our second visit.People come to the bar to chill and relax, if we want another drink we will let you know in our own time!!It's a shame I had to write this as it is a really cool place to hang out and eat - with a great atmosphere.

The negatives are directly related to the pluses: being a bar, it can by raucous - when I was having dinner there was a group of 10-12 people playing drinking games in the bar. It was a lot of fun for them (and I didn't much mind, I can read whatever the distractions), but I wouldn't have wanted to be a couple having a meal, or indeed anyone trying to have a conversation.The menu is a little eclectic - part Western food (mushroom soup, bouillabaisse, grilled lamb, lobster thermidor) and local dishes (mee goreng, butter prawns, squid with chilli). I stuck with local dishes which were astonishing affordable: the excellent 21Bistro Bee Hoon (basically fried noodles) for RM10 and some butter prawns (delicious) for RM25. As I said, there are no wines by the glass which was hugely disappointing, and a small Asahi was RM14.That said, this is the perfect place for a group, or for singles wanting to drink and eat - if you're looking for an intimate dinner, this is not the place.

The salad was fresh with slices of green apple, celery, walnut and lettuce. Well done. The thin crust of the pizza was crispy with delicious toppings of mushroom, spinach and roasted pumpkin in the melted cheese. The ribeye steak was very tender with adequate flavour of the marination. You can actually eat it without the Sarawak special sauce provided.Service was excellent. Staff increased the fan speed as it was quite warm at the ground level.

PaulOoiPenang,Rooftop Seafood Heaven,"At Jalan Pudungan and right on the rooftop of UTC Building is where this Topspot Foodcourt is located. We stayed at the Imperial Riverbank hotel which is minutes walk to this destination. Mind you, if you have knee problem I'd advise you to look for the entrance with a service lift to take you up to the food court. It is indeed a steep stairs climb up, not easy & not advisable for elderly people.... so keep that in mind.Once you are at the top of this foodcourt, walah !! you will see many stalls lighted up with colourful neon lights bearing their stall’s name. Fresh seafoods on display and live stock in water tank for the picking. Mainly seafoods stall, halal as well. Then they have satay stalls too. According to the review we read, #25 is a safe choice to pick for a satisfying seafood dinner experience. We were pleasantly served by friendly staff and the seafood we had were as expected, we really had a great time and value for money. Prices here are reasonable except for drinks, I ordered the “am bela” fruit drinks that cost RM5.00 a glass which I felt expensive as it is a local fruit drink. Anyway, moving on to the taste of the seafood and the freshness, they were really delicious to taste & fresh especially the steamed fish in spicy lime sauce, was truly awesome ( please see photo ). The Kuching Öh Chian” is very much different from the Penang ones, it is like eating crispy biscuit with oyster in it for the picking and they are really indeed tasty. The seating were mostly in the open air style with some partial shelter, pretty dimly lighted which I find not to my liking. Crowded at night at time just like “pasar” atmosphere, noisy and full of people having a good time, chatting and eating at the same time. Overall, it is a place full of energy with busy activity, which is a good thing.

It is located on the 6th floor of a multi-storey car park of the UTC Building. It is open from 5.00 pm till midnight. There are several restaurants and drink stalls located side-by-side, each displaying various types of fishes, prawns, crabs, squids, shellfish, vegetables, etc. Live fishes and crabs are also displayed in glass tanks and containers for diners to choose. Among the fishes offered here include those that are not commonly available elsewhere, e.g. parrot fish. Big round tables and plastic chairs fill the common dining area. The whole place is very lively and usually packed during weekends and holidays.Diners choose the types of seafood that they want to eat and have them weighed to get the price. Then tell the proprietor how they want the chosen seafood to be cooked. Service is fast even on a crowded night as there are many helpers around. Among the dishes we like are the steamed fish, crabs fried with salted egg, curry-fried clams and stir-fried 'midin', a local fern-like vegetable. Prices depend on the type and weight of the seafood chosen, be prepared to pay more for the less-commonly available ones.Besides the usual carbonated drinks and fruit juices, fresh coconut water, sugarcane juice as well as beer are also available. There is also a stall selling satay (local barbecued meat in skewers). It is a recommendable place for a good seafood dinner.

"GromblerThursley, United Kingdom","If you like food courts, you'll love this one","Having eaten in food courts in Singapore, Hog Kong and even elsewhere in Borneo, we were told by several taxi drivers to try this one. It's on top of a car park and the entrance is incredibly hard to find. Even when you've found it, there's no signage to tell you to take the lift to the top floor. And even when you emerge, you have to experiment with doors to find it. But once on the roof terrace, it's HUGE. There are about 10 stalls all neatly arranged along two edges of the area. My guess is there's seating for a couple of hundred people at clean tidy round tables. The stalls don't have pictures on menus that you would expect at food courts, but an incredible array of beautifully displayed fresh seafood all presented on ice. Each stall also has a wide selection of vegetables and other exotic choices like fungi and a local delicacy made from young ferns called midin. You simply point at the fish and/or shellfish you'd like to have prepared for you or just pick it up and put it on a tray along with your selection of veg etc. They weigh it, tell you how much it will cost, and then ask how you'd like it cooked. Plenty of advice is offered but the choices seem to be fried, grilled or steamed. They also offer the usual rice and noodle dishes plus sauces like oyster and spicy. I didn't recognise any of the fish so asked for advice which was readily given about the various options. Basically you have freshwater or saltwater, large and small, predators and grazers, reef and open water, etc. No doubt some (if not all) endangered, but they looked plentiful, so I guess you just trust the authorities know what they're doing (probably not true, but we can hope). All the seafood looked incredibly fresh at every stall. We opted for stall 33, but 25 also seemed popular (we arrived very early so there was hardly any activity to help us judge). We took a seat and were provided with cutlery plus (tiny) serviettes... which seemed incredibly rare generally in a country producing so much of the world's wood. My fish (steamed with ginger and chilli), veg (in oyster sauce) and rice (egg fried) arrived within 10 minutes. Perfectly cooked, fell off the bones and absolutely delicious! It was a species I'm sure I've never had before and was recommended by the beaming and chatty stall lady.So different from the usual food court. Modern, clean, fresh and great fun.

GPenafloridaKuala Lumpur,Kelabit Cuisine..,"Although the restaurant is right next door to the Tune Hotel Kuching where I'd stayed, I'd only tried it out on my last day in Kuching. When I arrived at 2.00pm for a late lunch, I was the only one there. The menu was quite extensive offering a wide variety of ethnic & local dishes interspersed with a few Western dishes.I opted for the set lunch where you can choose a meat dish, 2 vegetables to go with it & a drink, all for RM16.90. So, I chose the chicken cooked in bamboo, the potato leaves & local asparagus, served with the famous Bario rice & a bowl of wild brinjal soup. The cinnamon lemon tea sounded interesting, so, I tried that.The food didn't take to arrive but it gave me enough time to check out the decor & the premises. The decor is simple, uncluttered, a bit of modern mixed with ethnic touches. I like how the whole place looked & felt bright & cheery. Overall the place isn't all that big with some tables on the inside & a few more outside.My meal arrived & it looked.. green! I suppose if you don't like vegetables, this would be a nightmare, but fortunately I do. For many Asians, especially if chillies & spicy food is a big part of the diet, this will seem rather bland. I actually thought it felt very healthy as dishes were either steamed, blanched or a quick stir fry. Plus, it's assured in the menu that absolutely no MSG is used. It's different, it's quite flavourful with lots of ginger & lemongrass used in the cooking but I reckon it's not for everyone. The cinnamon lemon tea, after adding some sugar, was absolutely yummy!Overall I enjoyed the food & ambiance. I would love to return with either another person or group to try out dishes from the ala carte menu, maybe some dessert & definitely the coffee.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 6 July 2014 ,Tribal Stove

The long jungle ferns were curly and crunchy and had the ‘wok hei’ taste. Probably tossed in big fire.Another dish was the fried gonjeng (Hong Boi fish 凤尾魚 ) – deep fried small fish. It was a little salty and quite oily. Something like ikan bilis in bigger size. The last dish was the so-called money veg – not sure why it has such name. It was fried with egg and had a bitter taste. Quite normal.All the dishes we ordered came in record time.

It's selection and freshness can be dubious at best. Lots of local vegetables,ferns and what-nots are stacked up on an tabletop.Pricing is based on whether you are a local,tourist or on an expense account. Usually preferential treatment is given to guests and patrons who happen to be either related or of the same dialectical background as the owner - whom I find to be bossy,obnoxious and loud. However the boss-lady (towkay-neo) is pretty nice and decent. Service levels are atrocious - most of the time you have to help yourself to extra utensils etc.The food and dishes served varies in quality (and quantity) depending on the mood of the cook(s).

My son had the spaghetti bolognese, I had the Hawaiian burger (single burger with pineapple and cheese) and my husband had the double burger with cheese. These were all comparatively priced with similar restaurants in the area. We had to complain about the double burger as one of the burgers was not cooked properly. They gave us that meal for free, which was considerate of them. I really enjoyed the burger I had and my son enjoyed his meal. We then all had the Lime Cheesecake. This was not the consistency I expected of a cheesecake, as it was quite dense, not light and mine did not taste of lime (although after I squeezed the accompanying lime onto it, it did). I must have had a piece from a different batch because the other two pieces were much nicer. I didnt like to complain again and I ate it all anyway. Who likes to waste dessert??

To our dismay, only 1 crab was served instead of 2!!! Unfortunately we were originally quoted for xx kg and 2 crabs...the crab that was served was somewhat smaller The staffs apologized for the mistake, blamed kitchen mixed up. We had to reselect another crab and had to wait for the other crab to be cooked. What I am not happy about is obviously we were not paying for what we ordered...They gave complimentary fried buns which were worth 4 ringgit to compensate...but that won't up for the stupid mistake.My mom spoke to her friends about our experience at the restaurant last night. Apparently she was told this is not new and has happened to others. Past patrons complained about ordering xx kg prawns etc but when served amount seems somewhat lesser. I can't say if this is an honest mistake but if this has happened many times to others, one start to question the integrity of the restaurant. Why cheat?This is bad reputation for the restaurant.

"elephants59Oxford, United Kingdom",Yummy Seafood for a Great Get Together with Family & Friends,"We arrived just before 8pm & couldn't find any parking spaces within the vicinity! However, as my relatives were familiar with the restaurant, they were able to drop us off & find nearby parking!I was quite impressed with the interior on the ground floor. All the seafood available is either displayed swimming in their tanks (Super Fresh!) or laid out market style so that you could select whatever catches your appetite! Apart from the prawns being my favourite food, I left the selection to my cousin! We started the meal with some drinks, mostly hot tea, larger & soft drinks. I had a reasonable mango juice - it was not as strong in flavour as I would have preferred; slightly on the watery side. As a foreign visitor to this area & as I hadn't made the food selection, I was unaware of the name of the dishes! We started off with some pickled white cabbage - I'd tried this before at other Chinese restaurants, & always enjoyed this appetiser! Next came an assiette of various hor d'ourves on a selection dish. There was a prawn dish in the centre, which looked like a coleslaw concoction but tasty so much better! There were about five other types of dishes on this tray - all very yummy!Then a well known green vegetable, very high in iron minerals but also quite expensive! It was reasonably tasty! Next was some deliciously fat prawns - unfortunately we had de-shell ourselves! We had various seafood & chilli sauces for dipping! This was followed by some bamboo clams, which were quite easy to prise away from their shells. It was nice to try something new & be adventurous but not a dish I personally could live without! Though I did enjoy their scrambled shark fin omelette, which was surprisingly tasty but I felt a bit unsettled as imagined the Sharks trying to swim without their fins! They also had something that resembled a dark green chopped up cabbage with omelette, which was very appetising. Next came roasted quail's legs & wings; nice to have something different for a change but it's a lot of work for such little meat! It looked like it had been marinated in soy a sauce as it had a dark consistency to it. It tasted fine but my taste buds wouldn't cry out for it! To make our waist line expand even MORE, fried fish steaks was brought out! This was supposed to be a very expensive fish & the steaks were very large! Fortunately there were 12 of us to devour the dishes! It was crispy on the outside, with a very fleshy white meat! I enjoy my seafood & was happy to sample this costly dish! It want a melting moment but I was happy to try & see what an expensive fish tasted like! We thought that that was the final dish, when they brought out some shelled crab in a honeyed-like sauce. Unfortunately the waiter forgot to leave a set of shell cracker, so I picked the soft shelled portion & tried to prise out the flesh with my teeth & long nails! Fortunately my dentures held out & I didn't make a fool of myself! . I enjoyed this dish - and would have eaten more if it hadn't been so late coming out! We finally finished the meal with a healthy array of fruits! This contained one of the best juiciest mangoes I ever eaten! It was firm but also very tasty! Unfortunately I had to share it with 11 other people and was peeved to only get a few slices! They also served some papaya & a very large grapefruit-like fruit, the name escapes me at this moment, but it was firm, juicy & did not taste at all like a grapefruit! There was so much to eat, we took home 1 of the fish steaks & a decent amount of the crab!I got the impression that we had the attention of 1 waiter to cater almost solely for our table. He appeared to provide an abundance of lagers but never ascertained if I wanted my glass topped up! Or was I too busy to order more?! It was enjoyable trying all these dishes & most of them new to me! This was certainly a popular venue but I wouldn't say the food melted in my mouth! I can say that of only a few places! I certainly didn't find all the dishes to be exceptional! This could be because of my own taste buds! And as I was being treated, I'm not aware of the cost - only that it would have been very expensive; especially as we also had a private room!

ShahidatulA6,Terrible,"I just ate there with my partner about 3 days ago and it was a disappointment. For RM95 per pax for the signature beef buffet, it was not worth it at all. I'd give it a 2 out of 5. Firstly, all of the meat were cold. None of them are warm or newly cooked. Imagine eating a steak or chicken or lamb chop that is cold, constantly being served. The lamb was not chewy which is good but since it was cold, you can taste the rough sandy texture around the side of the fats which is supposed to be delicious. And the service there, some of the staff were very friendly, but there are also some that keep on shoving food after another onto your plate even though you have not finished your previous meal ! This service actually use a small token that has ""thank you"" and ""serve me"" on each side, serve me is used when you want to be served and ""thank you"" is when you want to be left to enjoy your food. But even when i used the thank you side, this lady keep on adding food on my plate ! Imagine wanting to enjoy your dinner and the waiter keep on distrupting you just to add more and more food to your plate. Some of the beef was so chewy and too rare, and the marinating of the beef, chicken and lamb wasn't too good either. Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant dinner at all. Will not return again. Hopefully they will improve so future customers can enjoy food that is worth paying RM95. ThanksShow less",2.0,Reviewed 29 December 2017 ,The Carvery Restaurant

That was the only part of the dinner documented by our pictures.The meat selection was extensive, including Lamb leg, Chicken Wings, BBQ Mussles, Black Pepper Beef Ribs, Lamb Chop, Lamb Shank, Roasted Pineapple, Beef Steak, Smoked Beef, Smoked Turkey, Chicken Sausage, Beef Sausage, Chicken Chop, Fish & Chicken Skewer.Sadly, this was one of those times were quantity does not meet quality! The meat was of a poor quality and even poorly cooked. The Ribs were drown in a black pepper sauce ""molasses-type"", simply inedible! The pineapple was having a disgusting mixed taste of sugar and roasted meat juices, the sausages tasted like rubber and the mussel were completely covered by a spicy bottle-type tomato-chilli sauce mixture. It was simply too much; clearly they do not have a clue of what is a Brazilian BBQ!The bill (we paid RM 403.00 for a party of 4) was in our opinion not justified by the quality of the food.We went back home disappointed and we kept drinking water throughout the whole night!Show less",2.0,Reviewed 2 June 2016 ,The Carvery Restaurant

Boxing day comes and we make our way over to the resturant and get seated. The resturant was now starting fill up.The concept was explained to us and we first made our way to the salad bar. To be honest we should have left the resturant at that time with our first impression. The selection was less than adequate as well as unappealing. We did select a couple of items an headed back to our table for the rest of the dinner to start. When the meats started to arrive they were not served in the same mouth watering anticipation that had been our previus experiences elsewhere. If I recall there was 14 choices. I would not have guessed that a ""wiener"" or ""snag"" would make the menu......but there it was. The meats when carved had to be sawed of the skewer. The sirloin was the strongest tasting meat I have ever had. We made it through the first round and spoke to waiter for the two choices that we would have for round two. He came out with these sliced on a plate the promptly slid equal portions of each onto our plates and left with my wife and looking amazed at what had just happened. What appetite we had remaining was gone. We finished our second glass of the house red ,""which I might add was very good"" and settled the bill and left. We have been living in South East Asia for almost 3 years now and have realigned our expectations for anyone trying to serve western food. We are somewhat relaxed in our expectations now and have a let's give a try attitude when dining western.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 8 January 2012 ,The Carvery Restaurant

iisechewMalaysia,"You pay for what you get - pricey, but Worth it all","Keeper's Ground, a café located in The Spring Mall, serves perhaps the finest gourmet dishes one can find in Kuching. Certainly on the pricier side, here is where I mouth the clichéd saying, 'you pay for what you get'. Speaking of the environment of this place, the designs are beautiful - a very sleek & modern feel with lush greens bringing a certain freshness to the place. The service is excellent - the team is ever ready to serve guests. Keeper's Ground has their very own bakery, where their pastries are served fresh from the oven. I particularly love their cinnamon roll - crisp at the outside, fluffy in the inside with a sinful sugar coating and a rich cinnamon punch. Their cakes are spectacular, and very artfully displayed for the perusal of customers. Their cuisine served is top-notch. Dishes like the 'Multigrain Fried Rice' is Michelle's favourite - consistent every single time we visit this café, the rich colours of the red rice, purple cabbage, coupled with quinoa never fail to impress. None of the dishes I've tried here as ever failed me. The KGB Burger (is that ?Keeper's Gourmet Burger?) serves a succulent home-made beef patty with crunchy sweet potato fries.Keeper's Ground has a rich selection of teas and beverages. I've tried some of their flower teas (Rose of my life, lavenders in provence) and they were really nice. Aside from the pricey part, I easily give this place a 5-star.

We took the truffle chips which arrived fresh and crisp, with a generous serving of parmesan. The lamb rack was tasty but a little tough, while the beef rib was elegantly presented with mushy peas and very tasty.

There are only 3 (THREE) things on the menu. A chicken dish, an Umai(fish salad type thingy) and a vegetarian thing that I paid no need to as I am not a fan of non meat or fish based main course. I thought that with only these three things the chef might want to wow the diners with some amazing food. So, as I had too much meat I went for the Umai. Not much choice anyways. When the food arrived....lo and behold. OMG!! I have never felt angry, hangry, disappointed, misled and frustrated in all my Kuching dining experience. What was the chef thinking!!!

"yippopotamusWellington, New Zealand","Nice spot - This is a review of the Basaga restaurant, not the hotel","This is the restaurant attached the Basaga Holiday Residences. We had eaten at other restaurants for 2 previous nights and we felt like a night in this time. As far as hotel restaurants go, this was pretty good.The food was pretty good. It was tasty and there was plenty of it. My feeling is that locals may not enjoy the food as much as visitors, but it was still pretty good. We enjoyed it very much.There was a good amount of variety on the menu, both Malaysian and western selections. However, the seafood selection was very disappointingly sparse as Sarawak has loads of seafood. And I wish they had been brave enough to have a more Sarawakian themed menu. The prices are higher than other restaurants in Kuching, but that was expected from a hotel restaurant. So when considering the convenience value and taking transport into account, the value for money was not too bad.The service was attentive, the meals came quickly. The staff seemed enthusiastic and interested.It is an outdoor restaurant, and the ambiance was very, very relaxed. It would be good for families with kids of any age. It’s a place where you could have a long relaxing evening meal.Overall it was a good experience. The food was nice, it was convenient, the service was good and the atmosphere was good.

We ate at the restaurant and the local food choice was limited but what they did was good and service was good. All staff here were very friendly. Drinks were a little overpriced compared to other places. The locals like to come here to eat burgers and music goes on quite late. Breakfast was basic. There is a nice restaurant across the road from the hotel (absolute tribal) which has a huge menu choice with 3 chefs, Thai, Malay and Chinese. We went up country for a couple of nights and left our luggage in storage. Staff welcomed us back but we had a dark, dingy room with a broken shower (18) overlooked by adjacent buildings so had to keep curtains closed. Also closer to bar so noisier.

T-bone steak was ordered. It arrived around 20 mins after my partners dish (had to ask where it had gone) and when it did, my partner was all but finished. Ok service in a coffee shop but do expect better coordination from a restaurant. As for the steak itself, once I cut past the gristle and fat, there was some tasty meat, but not very much at all. No doubt it was T-bone, the bone was the dominant piece of the dish. Just way too little meat on it.We also wanted to have draft heineken and a can too. They had neither available. Same applied to Tiger. Pretty poor therefore to not have any lager on draft, just the more expensive Guinness, Hoegaarden and Kilkenny. Ordered large tiger bottles instead, which were reasonably priced. Staff were pleasant enough, but food should have really arrived at the same time - the delay was too much.Overall, its a pleasant setting. Liking the ambience however it does feel a little impersonal. When I compare to Jambu its not in the same league for atmosphere, or food quality for that matter.

King Ying L,Valentine's Day Scam,"Visited on Valentines day a couple of years back. Called to make reservations but was not informed that they only offered a special set dinner that night until we arrived. Moreover the set cost a whopping RM208 per person?! Decided to stay and eat anyway because all other restaurants would be full with reservations on valentines day. The set consisted of quite a few courses and a glass of wine. However, it was not worth the money at all. The beef soup was a tiny portion of plain broth with a few teeny strips of beef floating inside served in a huge fancy bowl. The most disappointing course (I forgot the name of it) was what resembled the chicken drumstick you'd get from your nasi lemak, except it was the tiniest drumstick I'd ever seen and had some sauce drizzled around it. The Wellington was soggy on the bottom and tasted a little sour like it had gone bad. There were maybe two other dishes that weren't as disappointing but were not above average and came in equally small portions. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the dessert of red velvet cake that came at the end. As a family of four we ended up paying a whopping 800 plus ringgit for the unsatisfying, superbly disappointing dinner.

"FaddySueKuching, Malaysia",Food Quality Maintained,"It has been more than a year since we had a meal at Tom's. The measure of a good restaurant is it's ability to maintain the food standard; be it taste, presentation and portion. The food quality hasn't changed much since it's opening and it remains as delicious as ever. However, the decor hasn't changed though. After being opened almost 20 years, I think it's time the restaurant gets a little makeover. The Xmas decorations are up so it covers the datedness a little and creates a festive atmosphere for the coming Yuletide.We had the mushroom vol au vent and garlic bread for starters. The vol au vent was new on the menu and was very good. Highly recommended! They also still serve the best garlic bread in town. We ordered the Fried Calamari Carbonara Pasta, Lasagne, Spaghetti Bolognese and NZ Rib Eye for main course. For dessert we had the Strawberry Tort and Chocolate Mousse Cake. As mentioned, the food remains delicious. The only problem is the price. The meal cost USD$ 60 in total, with drinks, when other restaurants would cost USD$ 45 for the same meal. The cost of a meal can also go up as high as you want as Tom's is one of the few restaurants that serve Wagyu beef. If you can afford it, the Wagyu steak costs USD$ 78 for 150grams. Expensive! That's the reason why we did not give a better rating coz we found the meal expensive even though food remains very good. Some of the best restaurants in the world are not necessarily the most expensive in the world. The dated decor also contributed to the average rating. A restaurant is not only rated by its food quality but also by the ambience. However, on a positive note, the service remains excellent. The restaurant has a good group of waitresses who will take your order promptly and serve you efficiently. Overall, we rate it 6/10. We would have given an 8 if the decor is updated and the pricing a bit more reasonable. The restaurant still serves good food though and you won't be disappointed. The service is top notch too.

"TCKLYKuching, Malaysia","Nice, cosy restaurant with room for improvement","Tom's has a great reputation in town for its high quality food, but also being pricey. However, most western food lovers wouldn't mind paying a little more for good food, including us. We dine at the restaurant on a weekend for dinner. The environment is nice and cosy, similar to some decent restaurants in Europe we have been to. While we were there, a guest sitting across the room was talking so loudly to his friends that we could actually follow their conversation. This was a little unpleasant during the meal but wasn't the restaurant's fault. The food are pretty good. We ordered a cream of broccoli and pumpkin soup for starters. For the main course, we had the aglio olio pasta and honey mustard chicken. I have to say that the pasta was very tasty but not the chicken, though the portions are pretty decent. The chicken was slightly undercook, where the thickest part of the thigh, touching the bone, was still red. I bet it would be well done if cooked for another 5 minutes. Having said that, the chicken arrived probably 15 minutes after the pasta dish, so we shared the pasta while waiting. The chef/ waitress can do a better job at their serving pace and timing, so that guests from one table can start eating courses at the same time.For the price range close to a hotel restaurant, I was expecting a more professional service.

It's very clearly this place caters to the local Malay population as well as offering sweet and flavourless food for the local Chinese to pretend they eat Indian food - I have even eaten better Indian food in provincial towns in China... We live in London and have travelled in India, so we have had great Indian food. However, I have also eaten Indian food throughout the world, including Malaysia - where in general, Indian food is good and authentic. Still, I have to say that even the worst Indian takeaway in some rural UK town is miles better than what they served as ""Indian"" food here. There was no Indian staff there during our visit, our ""butter paneer curry"" had pieces of tofu instead of paneer and otherwise consisted of the local spicy sauce diluted with ketchup. The okra curry was okra in ketchup with cream, cooked without any spices and our ""grilled meats"" tasted like they were marinated in fizzy drinks. The plain rice we ordered on the side was Chinese broken rice.Service was very efficient and friendly, to be fair, and the lassi was overly sweet, but decent. Prices were absolutely ridiculous for very tiny portions, about three times the usual Kucing price.Show less",2.0,Reviewed 8 January 2018 ,The Kings Curry

We ordered vegetarian samosa for entre (very bland), Garlic naan (delicious!!) and a paneer butter masala and mutton rogan josh for the mains. The curries were both very good.

Prices start at RM3 per bowl, but with extra ingredients will cost more. Every bowl is chocked full with char-siew (bbq'ed pork), bak-chor (minced pork), curly veggies, fried shallots and fresh chillies. The queue can be long if you go at the peak hours of between 6pm to 8pm, so try and stay clear of these timings.

Warren C,Meh.,"Been here and the food was decent for the price. But I've traveled to multiple places and the food truly could not compare. Would give it a solid 3 star but it does not deserve it. How they treat future/potential customers or majority of a generation with no respect is appalling. Claiming that only serve 'real' food to 'Real people', pretentious much? Everyone who does a certain thing are stupid? How can one say such things. They need to learn from the SG hawker stall who received a Michelin star. Staying humble and no price increase even when given the honors to a Michelin star. Whereas magenta insults people and say things that are out right ridiculous.

I live to eat and when the rare opportunity arrives to eat very well I'm beyond happy. Quite simply Magenta's menu, presentation, service, quality, but most importantly taste are in a league of their own in the whole of ASEAN for mainly western fare.On first glance and entry the restaurant is intriguing and stands out as its a converted castle on the waterfront which stands alone. The spiral staircase takes you up to a wonderful open space, very inviting, warm tones and given my time in Kuching was during the rainy season, a very pleasant surprise for sure.I opened the menu to find pages of selections that anyone would be impressed with and my biggest challenge was choosing as it all captured my interest. I went with the Lamb Shank based on my dining companions recommendations and what an impressive choice. Beautiful taste and texture rounded off with a perfect bed of mashed potatoes and rich but not overbearing paired sauce. The portion was spot on and the sides perfectly proportioned as well.Later we had a chance to meet the owner Dino who within 2 minutes of conversing you know where the inspiration comes from. Dino is serious about food and has the passion which delivers a true dining experience that you should not miss.My goal now is visit Kuching more often and reserve my dining at Magenta so I can experience the various menu items over time.Show less",5.0,Reviewed 8 April 2016 ,Magenta Restaurant

We had taken a small local ferry boat across the river with the intention of eating at the food court there. However, the food court was not at all appealing, so we continued our search and stumbled across My Village Barok. The restaurant is in a ramshackle wooden building, full of character. Much of the cooking is done on open grills outside, and all in all is a really atmospheric and interesting place to have dinner. The food is excellent and extremely good value for money. Service is a bit 'relaxed' - you can expect the waitress to sit on the table next to you and play with her phone when not busy! - but that didn't bother us at all. So I'd recommend this as a different alternative to in a quieter and more local part of town. To get there, walk past the Hilton (on your right side). You'll see a small jetty with wooden boats tied alongside. One of these can take you across the rive for 1 Ringgit. Once across you'll see a big food court. My Village Barok is behind this.

Midin cooked with BelacanPrice RM 120But my lust for the 'mussels' grilled right at the very doorstep of the restaurant stretched my pocket to RM 207 (+2 sets of Nasi Ayam Ketuk and Two Jugs of Ice Lemon Tea). RM 21 Per set of 7 mussels. Yes of course I ordered for a second serving of the 'mussels' The Meals: Very tasty, though the garnishing may need a bit more of improvement. Tom Yam soup with a tinge of 'santan', I have never been a big fan when its cooked together, however it blends quite well. One of the best Buttered Prawn, crispy, succulent and 'buttery'. Finger licking good. Mussels though it may looks overpriced but we are talking about mussels here. It is grilled fresh with a delicious 'coating' on top. I have tasted chilled Mussels with a tinge of lemon but Grilled Mussels with Sambal? Excellent.Staffs friendly and attentive, though a bit shortage during that particular time due to festive season.

Forget about Sushi King and Sakae Sushi, this place has the look and feel of a real Japanese restaurant - remember watching J-doramas like Long Vacation and Sweet Season and the feel of those restaurant scenes? Exactly that! The food served in Minoru are perfect, having tried many Japanese restaurant New Zealand and in Malaysia. The portions are just nice and the ingredients are not 100% local, from what I heard is that they air flown most of their ingredients from Japan, and the best thing is that they are fresh, especially their Salmon. I tried their special dinner sets, drinks, and sushi, and all of them tasted just nice and fresh too! The sushi deserves a special mention - they are made according to who's ordering, and for my girlfriend and I the chef made heart shape sushi and we didn't even asked for it, which was awesome! Another point is that the sushi are well made, it has perfect density and doesn't have the tendency to crumble when dipped into soy sauce. I can't stress how well the service was because it was way over our expectation and it is first class. The service crews are dressed in traditional Japanese clothing and that adds to the already perfect atmosphere that the place has. They are polite and very warm, in which I think should be an exemplar to other restaurants in Kuching.We left with a full stomach and glad that we spent our 2nd Year Anniversary together in this establishment.

We were handed nicely-designed menu and an order sheet which we have to write our order onto (food number). Flipping through their menu, they definitely serve the most complete varieties of Vietnamese cuisine! We ordered their signature pho and Vietnamese coffee, grilled porkchop rice, fresh springrolls and banh mi (baguette). The pho was excellent and comes in big portions of beef slices, beef cuts, beef balls and tendons. Taste was authentic and the broth was tasty. The coffee came in dripping filter, which was hard to find in Kuching. We were told the powder was from Vietnam and that explains the aroma that was different from local coffee. The porkchop rice was served with egg-pork patty as well. Fresh springrolls came with a special sweet and spicy peanut sauce. The prawns and vege wrapped inside were fresh. Their banh mi is a definite must-try! But we would prefer it to be cut in half before serving as the baguette was quite big.They did some upgrading to the surroundings since the last time we went. Now the walls are decorated with a huge canvas painting, and some Vietnamese straw hats. The place is clean, even the toilets are well-kept. Though some improvements are needed for the exteriors.

"oal151Kuching, Malaysia",Surprisingly Good!!!!,"Most restaurants that survive in Kuching tend to maintain consistent standards of being average to good or waver from one extreme to the other.So it was a pleasant surprise to note that this little Viet gem of a place is becoming increasingly better and better after each visit. I am a sucker for Vietnamese food, relishing its healthy cuisine of abundant fresh vegetables accompanying their meals , and visiting Nam Nam is reminiscent of my sojourn in Ho Chih Min and Hanoi not too long ago. I am told the chef himself is Vietnamese, which probably explains the authentic taste of its distinctive and delicate Vietnamese flavours of their dishes.I often order their special Beef Pho with rare slices of beef , tendons and beefballs. The portions are generous and simply sublime with sufficient beansprouts basil , lime and chilli given on the side. A Vietnamese meal would not seem complete without the popular Vietnamese spring rolls,( made from rice flour) either fried or fresh - both unique in their own ways. The only complaint I had was- it could come with more lettuces and perhaps herbs like the basil or mint leaves to wrap the spring rolls with especially for the fried ones. During this particular visit, , I ordered the Beef Stew Pho. This is rather different from the usual Pho with the clear beef consomme and rare slices of beef ; the soup was more flavourful ,and thicker as expected ( it was after all, described as a stew) and the large generous chunks of beef shin and tendons were cooked to perfection -firm yet moist and tender - simply one of the best beef Pho I have had ( and I have tried many Vietnamese restaurants around the world).My companion ordered a pork baguette which I had a bite . This was also very good; the pork succulent and flavourful and the baguette freshly warm and slightly crispy on the outside whilst moist and soft on the inside with condiments of lettuce , tomatoes and cucumbers- to make it a nourishing and healthy lunch . Other items which I almost always order if there is a bigger party would be the steamed rice rolls with minced pork fillings and the Ban Xeo( a Vietnamese pancake) .My other favourite item (which is almost always a tussle with the Beef Pho) is the vermicelli with the pork chop and the spring rolls. They also have innovative Vietnamese desserts ranging from the typical home made Caramel Custard, to Vietnamese yoghurt and 3 colour dessert , which I have tried only once as the portions for the main courses are generous and often leaves no room for dessert. Prices are also reasonable- from RM9.90- 15.90 for their main meals. For most restaurants, the menus tend to get boring after a while , but not Nam Nam. I noticed that with each visit, more and more dishes are added to the menu ( and posted on the walls). I am not sure who the owners are, but kudos to them for bringing so far the best Vietnamese cuisine to Kuching and maintaining its appeal for repeated customers by adding new authentic Vietnamese dishes to its already extensive menu. Each repeated visit gets better. Let 's hope they keep it up!Show less",5.0,Reviewed 5 July 2015 ,Nam Nam Vietnamese Cafe

"KellyB32Vancouver, Canada",When is this place open?,"This is not a review about the food as we haven't had the chance to actually eat at this restaurant yet. We were really excited to hear that there was an smokehouse restaurant in Kuching. We drove by one day and came back on a Tuesday afternoon to try it. Unfortunately the restaurant was not open. It was about 2 p.m. we asked someone inside and he advised us that lunch service was from about 11:30 until 1 and dinner started at around 6:30 p.m. We were disappointed, but we came back again on a Saturday for lunch making sure to be there on time at 12:00. The restaurant was closed again. There is a sticker on the door that says the hours are 6:30 p.m. until 10 p.m. Monday-Saturday. I am hoping that someone reads this review and posts the hours that this restaurant is open so that we can try it, I'm confused as to why a restaurant would only open for three and a half hours a day???Show less",2.0,Reviewed 27 July 2014 ,Mike's smokehouse

Too many restaurants are over-reaching, offering everything from steak to pizza to mee goreng and not doing anything well. They have one of the few 'smoker' ovens in town. The ribs are great, especially the magic dust ribs - tender and tasty. It would be nice if it came with more of the sides, e.g. another portion of the corn perhaps. This is because the portions are quite big, and it would be nice when sharing to have one each of the corn.The roast chicken was a bit dry, unfortunately. It was tasty, just the wings and drums were dried out. I believe this can be remedied by trussing your chicken before roasting it.Quite satisfactory, overall.

I was really thrilled when my friend and I made the last minute reservation to celebrate my birthday dinner there. we dressed up for the occasion of course. its a fine dining restaurant so we came with high expectation of a fine dining experience. we booked for dinner at 8.30pm. arriving at the hotel parking lot was full on both sides, ended up parked on the street. that didnt dampen our spirit. we went up to 17th floor there no button for 18th floor which was a bit confusing. anyway, we had to walk up stairs - which was unceremoniously not reflecting any 'fine dining' standards - maybe some elegant potted plants would definitely lift the place up a bit - especially for people like us who actually there for the experience. would be great to be thrilled all the way up to the entrance - do tease us! But boy! we were feasting our eyes with the amazing view of the city at that corner despite it was raining that evening. then into the restaurant we go. we had requested for window table and we got that and the view was amazing. we marveled at the view and start ordering and taking photos, lots of photos until our food arrived. we opt for sharing our food as i had birthday hi tea with the family earlier so I was not that hungry for full course dining. we chose the two appetizers, fresh oyster and beef carpaccio. Both were lovely, yum because they are my favorites! for main course we had steak, medium to well and a salad. beef was good though we thought the food plating or presentation especially the salad presentation wise was slightly disappointing. they were not up to a fine dining standard. others may not care but remember we were there for experience.. I have seen local cafes that way very creative and up to date with the way they presented the food, i am not even comparing for international fine dining restaurant. anyway, i do appreciate the fact that the restaurant is here. The menu rather limited but i prefer it that way if they can give quality and maintain satisfying experience. for dessert we had molten cake. yummy but rather too sweet to my liking. maybe its the chocolate they are using. if it is dark chocolate from good quality chocolate would definitely give more chocolaty and sugary sweet taste. i had had many molten cake mind you. well, food overall was good. loving it and i did have good time with my friend. the waiter and waitress seems very dilligent or probably slightly stressed? they were not making any contacts with the customer despite the restaurant was not busy or full that night. i complimented the dishes but no respond or acknowledgement at all for the waiter or waitress that served and cleared the plate. well, maybe they were tuned out that night. oh well. The after dinner we looked around and talked about the ambience, the interior decoration or table setting can be improved tremendously with more elegant touch here and there. they were slightly monotonous looking actually. maybe some potted plant here and there definitely lift the place up. also the doors to where the kitchen was so exposed - our table is right opposite so we saw all the actions. maybe a dividers or potted plants could soften the area and wont be so distracting to those seating near the door. and another thing is the music they are playing, its so so outdated it feels. may i suggest modern fresh music for instance Johannes Bornlof or celine roscheck, or many others great modern instrumental music.these were just our observation, like i said, we were there for experience. we were not totally disappointed anyway, because we were determined ti have fun that night and we had a great time there which we continue to the lounge one floor down. :)thank you again for opening this restaurant. it is a nice addition to our dinning experience in this charming town of ours.Show less",3.0,Reviewed 14 December 2018 ,Suasana On 18 Fine Dining

"lucyang99Kuching, Malaysia","Home-like atmosphere, home-cooked style food","Ah-soh Buntal Seafood is a restaurant that makes you feel you're eating at home. This very simple village wooden house is actually a family home. The small Soh family really lives there. The veranda serves as the dining area for the customers. Food is cooked in the actual family kitchen. What's unpretentious is that the wife is the only cook and manages the kitchen. Rarely does she have any kitchen helper. The husband, fondly called Ah Kian, does the marketing, taking customers' orders, serving, handling bills and receiving payments. Ah Soh is an affectionate and polite way of addressing Ah Kian, using his surname. If you value personalized service, this is THE place. We're satisfied with every dish we've taken so far. Menu is very basic. Food variety is limited and nothing fanciful. But if you want something out of the ordinary, give the proprietors about two days' notice to source the more expensive food items. Give Ah Kian a call at 082-846450; 082-846071; 0128901202. You can then make special menu requests and book your table. Just a word of caution, Ah Kian can sometimes be too chatty and appear too friendly for some. We always find him entertaining with his endless topics of conversation. He's just naturally spontaneous and genuinely enthusiastic. A couple of times, we saw him actually being told off and scolded by some irritated customers. Ah Kian is always prepared to go out of his way to help and accommodate customers. I would give Ah-soh Buntal Seafood a rating of ""excellent"" if its menu offers a wider variety of items.

Its disturbing to be served main courses with PAPER PLATES for the RM 150 spent tonight. Apparently, the boss' policy is to serve standard porcelain plates only if the place is booked. We were the only customers tonight and went there ordering the most expensive dishes for Mother's Day. I'm sure I would have cut the paper plates the smittherines trying to slice the beef on them. Please change this ""lazy to clean the plates policy"" - This is not a hawker shop selling rojak. Food: To the chef, good effort and big portions. We tried 3 dishes: 1. Destino Signature Salad: RM 25.90 - Lettuce, tomato, orange, apple, salmon, nice seasoning with a tinge of spicy.2. Hungry Nerd RM 79.90: Mixed platter of bland pasta and 4 types of roast meat. Lamb was excellent, chicken good, sausage.. like a normal sausage just bigger. The beef was a little hard -- unfortunate for us and fortunate for our happy canine. The black pepper sauce was average, but the the mushroom sauce was nice. 3. Seafood Aglio Olio - RM 29.90- Good pasta texture, with white cream sauce and a good selection and amount of abalone, mussel, prawns & chut chut. Good choice. 4. Flower Tea Pot RM 12.90 - It was refillable, but stood up eacn time for a refill. Back to service, the cashier boy did make effort in recommending good dishes and had pleasant mien, however the other 3 young staff were squashed behind the counter; could have done rounds by asking us how the food was or if there was anything else we needed. And perhaps learn answer criticisms better, instead of making faces behind the counter. They are more than welcomed to make faces if this were indeed a rojak hawker shop. As mentioned above, the service is more tailored for coffee and cake. Atmosphere: Rustic with unique table designs i.e. sewing machine, gosh, sorry i leave no surprises here. Background music would complete the ambience.Overall:As in all service providers, you're only as good as your last performance. Maintenance of good standard & service is always a challenge, especially if the next review may turn up in the newspapers, magazines or tv reviews.

Also ordered the Thai charcoal-grilled chicken. I would say if we're talking normal chicken dish, it would be fine. Good crisp on the skin, the right colours, not dried up meat. But if we're talking Thai charcoal-grilled chicken in its own essence, this barely lives up to its name. In fact, it should've been called Crispy Skin Chicken... Briefly, the chicken was either poorly marinated or not marinated at all. It lacks that aroma and rich flavours that should come with this dish. The sauce that should compliment the dish didn't live up to its role. I stuck to eating the bird without it. As for the Green Curry Chicken, I wasn't sure what was going on with the dish.

As it was served earlier than we anticipated (since we were told it would be served after dinner and at the time, we were really only halfway through dinner), it was exposed to the environment for a while, I will have to give the benefit of doubt regarding the dryness of the sticky rice.

Walked to the staff at the counter to place my order because no one came and was told to sit down and wait. After my order was finally taken, a more senior staff came and asked how many of us were dining. ""Two"" i replied, and she let out a very loud sigh in front of me.

The food came and my roast duck and roast pork noodles were cold. The noodles had already stuck together in an oily clump. Asked for chili sauce and was again told to wait - it never came.

Therefore, no matter how mediocre the offering is, it won't never be subpar anyhow. Imperial Duck's layout is akin to Western standard where the kitchen is see-through and that staff in their uniform stands guard to attend to customers right away. Whilst most of the staff comprises of local native people, I'm pleasantly surprised to note that they are multi-lingual and that they are empathic towards the needs of the customers. Once again, that's a rarity in Kuching where ambivalence is the keyword when it comes to providing customer service. Food is okay, noting that food such as Imperial Duck is Northern Chinese cuisine. Even if they engage Northern Chinese chefs, they may not be able to source the right type of ingredients to make such cuisine with immaculate flavour.

Imperial Duck is no different.As the name suggests, they specialize in duck dishes. However, you are also spoilt for choice in BBQ meats. -roast pork, belly pork, chicken and of course duck.I was told that the duck is smoked and roasted with mango wood or peach wood, hence a fruity fragrance arouses your senses when you take a bite. The deep rich reddish brown skin is crispy yet the meat inside is succulent and tender.There is also the mango duck - a dish with pieces of roasted duck each atop a thick slice of mango drizzled with a sweet and slightly tart mango sauce, which does not overpower the dish but helps to enhance the flavour of the duck.One can choose to have either rice or noodles but try the noodles as it is homemade on the spot.You can also watch the chefs at work through a glass window on the ground floor. Seating is on 2 floors with the air conditioner on the higher floor. There are also other dishes on the menu- their healthy and nourishing soups are very popular with the locals as well as their clay-pot rice.One can either have a one-dish quick lunch affair or have a host of dishes to entertain and satisfy a group.For the latter, it is advisable to book in advance as tables for more than 4 are limited and are located upstairs.They also serve a good selection of shanghainese tim-sum with the usual shanghai dumplings and buns.I am not one to care for shanghai dumplings but my guests felt they were expertly made with very thin floury skin and a bite into the dumpling brought forth a tasty spoonful of broth which is what makes shanghai dumplings great!

"Jennifer ACuenca, Ecuador",Incredible Homemade Burgers - Best in Kuching,"I've been coming to Kuching off and on for 15 years and I have been to the food court where Cats Pyjamas is many times. I never tried the stall as most burger stalls in Malaysia tend to consist of Ramlee burgers which are relatively flavourless and swimming in mayonnaise and chili sauce so you can choke it down. But last night I was craving a burger and wandered over to Cats Pyjamas Burger and I am so happy that I did. I was instantly greeted by the proprietor who was incredibly friendly and helpful. He told me that his most popular item was the beef, cheese and pineapple and asked me what I would like. Now the menu is pretty vast and I took a second to skim the offerings. But as I did I noticed something I've never seen at a burger stand in Kuching..... A large container of REAL BEEF. Usually it's just a freezer with frozen patties. It was then I began to suspect this might be a totally different experience. I ordered a beef and cheese and then asked what came on the burger.I was amazed at how quickly my burger arrived. The owner brought it over along with a tissue dispenser saying, ""Burgers are a messy business"". I took a moment to lift the bun and take a look. The patty was indeed homemade as it was not the usual perfect circle of pink meat. It looked fantastic. Making it even better the onions had been cooked in the meat juices and the ingredients all were fresh. And best of all there was just the perfect amount of ketchup and mayo. Feeling good about my decision I dove in.Oh my goodness it was amazing. The first thing that I noticed was that the bun was delicious too. So often burger stalls overlook a good bun. It had soaked in all the juices and was firm and soft and delicious. Then I hit the meat. It was glorious. The edges were crispy and the middle was juicy and just filled with flavour. It was the best stall burger I can recall having in Malaysia. I eagerly devoured the whole thing and then went back over and ordered another. They are rather small but as inexpensive as they are they are an insanely good value. The second one arrived just as fast as the first and it was just as good the second time around.I will ABSOLUTELY eat there again and again and I heartily recommend it to anyone.

"angie jKuching, Malaysia",Utterly disgusting!!!,"The only reason I gave this place one star is for the external decor. That's it. Nothing else. I've just left the place about half an hour ago. In anguish and nausea. Let me relate my experience...Upon arriving, we were rather impressed with the ""tranquil-looking"" decor outside. However, it was like entering a haunted house as there were no one at the entrance. Braving ourselves, we entered and were further greeted by a unique-looking entrance ie a bridge over a pond. That ended at an uninhabited-looking counter with loads of signboards and a chain that blocked our path. Finally a man came, and the first thing he said was ""Take off your shoes. Read the signboard"". A ""Hello"" would have been nice! Taken aback, we complied and assumed that this curt man was one of the waiters.As we reached the beverage counter, we were told to order from the self-order counter. Looking at the haphazard menu, it became apparent that we only had very limited items to choose from. Sigh. All that done, we were told to carry our own drinks to our table. Food was quick. Food presentation sucks. Serving plates were cheap and chipped. Utensils cheap and dirty. Dish plates were huge. Portion extremely small. Price is exorbitant! Here's what we ordered:1. Salad : fruit and vegetable with virgin coconut oil. A fistful of the abovementioned, mixed with RAW ANCHOVIES! Eeeuuuggghhh! Bland and tasteless. Price: RM 28.2. Yang Chow Fried Rice: Nothing Yang Chow abt it. No mixed vege or char siu meat. Just eggs, a minute amount of leafy vegetables and a small piece of deep fried chicken on top. Also bland and tasteless. Price: RM 12.3. Spaghetti bologna: Why did they have to cut the spaghetti into 3-inch lengths??? It was soggy and overcooked with very minimal sauce and even more minimal beef that it was nonexistent. No mushrooms, no tomatoes, no onions, no basil and oregano, no nothing. Just plain cheap and bland tomato sauce and sprinkles of minced beef. The sauce was not even put on top of the spaghetti noodles. It came all mixed up, like as if it was some leftovers from another customer. Yucks!Price: RM 16.4. Spicy lamb: This is the ultimate of all disgusting dishes I've ever had. It came mostly in small chopped up pieces that was half cooked and smelled extremely ROTTEN. 3/4 of the dish was mainly inedible spices and lemongrass stalks that were unceremoniously dumped in. We couldn't take more than a bite. We had it packed for the neighborhood stray. It was THAT bad! Price: RM 30++5. Smoked chicken: This is the only edible dish. But it came with a peculiar version of mushroom sauce that I should warn you against taking. Very very small piece with no other condiments.Price: RM 20++As for drinks, you can choose alcoholic or non-alcoholic. For non-alcoholic, you only have the option for fruit juices and canned drinks. We had the canned drinks that were extremely diluted in ice and paid RM 5 for each. Internal decor was messy and the floor was very dusty and dirty (why bother asking us to take off our shoes if you can't keep your place clean?!). They tried to make it look traditional and homely but it failed miserably. There were two pet cats loitering inside and I thought it was rather unhygienic to have them sit on our chairs and climb onto the tables. What about some concern for those who has allergies, huh? The lighting inside was pretty dim. And they kept on switching off the lights, making it difficult to see what we're consuming. Oh dear, that's not very pleasant. And we had our table cleared immediately after we finished our meal. Personally, this is rather rude. It made us feel rushed and hey, it's not as if they're so busy or what. We were the ONLY dining table there! Payment time: Because they do not bring the bill to your table, we walked to the counter to pay. When we arrived earlier, I asked if they accept credit cards and the girl said yes. So I whipped out my card and that very same girl I asked earlier looked at the curt man (who asked us to read the signboards upon entry) and they exchanged a ""look"" that I couldn't comprehend. At this point I realized that this curt man is actually the owner! Such poor PR skills I might add. So this owner told me gruffly that they would charge me an additional 10% for credit card usage. Heck, I'm not gonna give them an extra RM 14 for such services! Thank God I brought enough cash to pay them RM 139 for our total bill. This is one place that cuts your throat and bleeds you to death, with their standards and pricings. I wouldn't want to step another foot here ever again. And I would advice you the same too. No one here is friendly and helpful. No one attends to you, in case you would like to have an extra spoon or tissue papers. You'd have to hunt them down for any further requests. I am now worried that I might get food poisoning from that rotten lamb. My tummy don't feel so good and I've been feeling nauseous since the drive back.

It was after lunchtime and before dinner so there wasn't a lot of people around and the restaurant was quiet. We were looking for lunch as we spent the morning walking around the cultural village. We all ordered our meals and it took a long time to deliver mainly because the waitress had to come back twice and explain that our dishes were not available. Anyway, that happens so I wasn't too bothered. When the food eventually arrived some of it (the fish dishes) were not cooked right so we sent them back. The chef insisted that that's the way they should be cooked!!! Who am I to argue with that? So, we didn't eat them; they were runny and undercooked. When we went to pay they didn't charge for one of the fish dishes because it was untouched so I think that was a nice touch from them. Thank you. When my brother went to pay for his meal they didn't have the right change so the person behind the bar got out some keys, opened the charity box and gave him the change from that!!! On the positive side, it's a great location overlooking the sea so it has a beautiful view. You can walk from there down to the beach (which we did).

The location is nice but the bar really can do so much better. It's New Year's Eve, people! But the bar seemed to hold a half-hearted attempt at celebrating. No party packs, no drinks offers, just set meals and sitting arrangements which they try to force down patrons throats e.g. one area is only for those meant to spend RM200 and above, another (with some lights not functioning) is for below. Which is kinda weird because normally nightspots do this via buying bottles to reserve spots (e.g. if you spend RM400 above liquor then you get to book a VIP spot but not here, its just by some lump sum indeterminate of what you are spending on). Our group was definitely spending way more, since we were having dinner and drinks. Anyway the staff was nice enough to check with the kitchen since some of us wanted to order from their regular menu, not their fixed New Years Eve menu (which wasnt such a great selection). Food was not too great (hint: if the staff does not ask how you want your sirloin steak done, what does that tell you? Crispy steaks! LMAO. The salmon wasnt too bad).

The soup was light but the taste had an obvious presence of chinese cooking wine. Although, it was not my preference but, I think it was a special feature for this stall. The soup also had generous mixture pork pieces, meat ball, fish ball, vegetables and assorted pig's ""spare parts"" or internal organs (but I think you can exclude these organs if you mention it while ordering).

"Tydus_cKuching, Malaysia",Pretty place that falls short,"This place has been re-branded as B Greenhouse.The decor is nice, and there is ample parking.This is an establishment that appeals to a certain type of customer who likes 'safe' western food even though it is highly overpriced. Very much caters to local taste.We had a few dishes. The pizza had a home-made thin crust and was quite nice. I found the beer can chicken gimmicky. The chicken itself was tender and tasty. You are supposed to eat it with the beer as a 'sauce' which I forego because it just tasted like beer. The potatoes that came with it were rubbery and salty, but the veg was ok. What I really took offence with is that they expect you to eat with rubber gloves, which I don't find acceptable at a nice restaurant.We had a bottle of their entry level wine (around Rm130) which i would consider a table wine that retails for RM40 at a supermarket. They do have other nicer options, all of which have been marked up too much (hence my choice of the 'cheapest' wine)The staff are well-meaning but not well trained. e.g. they don't keep track of who orders what, and serve from the left or right as they wish.Don't get me wrong, I may have griped about the price but I`m not a cheapskate. I am willing to pay if I feel that its worth it.

"CCallanMelbourne, Victoria, Australia","Under serviced, poor quality, overpriced","I'm weirdly amazed by their service. After waiting for 5-7 minutes at the outdoor seating area somebody finally came over to us. And instead of greeting us, the waiters stared at us. You could probably imagine the service for the rest of the night. The restaurant is not busy at all but we waited for another 30 minutes for our food to come, and the worst part is that they even delivered our dishes to the wrong table!While the food is slightly better than the service, but certainly not the best we had. We had steak burger with wedges. The burger was crunchy. The steak was just better than those you get from hawker stalls and not even restaurant level. The wedges tasted like those frozen wedges you can get from any local stores. And this is the first time in my life, a restaurant actually served their customers with cold and soggy wedges.We had chicken, which was terribly overcooked and dry inside. We'd tried the pork as well, not perfectly cooked nor marinated.

After waiting patiently for our food for one and a half hour, we decided to ask the waitress. But instead of apologizing for the long wait, she accused us that one of our dish had already been served which obviously is not the case. Those sitting beside us who arrived after we did had already had their dishes served. She said she would check it out but after another 30 minutes she didnt get back to us so we decided not to wait anymore so we asked another waitress to cancel our food orders and just pay the bills for our drinks. The waitress said ok (no apology again) but left us waiting AGAIN for another 15 minutes. Couldnt bear it anymore, we decided to go to the counter and get the bill ourselves, To the owner of porkies, if you really cannot secure enough workers to run your restaurant, please dont bother to open your shop at all, it sucks big time.

The sausage platter used to be a sight to behold. A few types of sausages, beautiful presentation, generous sauces, interesting sides...and simply delicious!!! Now, perhaps likely to cut costs, the whole platter is so bare, so plain. Only one type of sausage is on the platter now, a few salad leaves and a little squirt of dressing, barely enough to go round the 3 salad leaves. We asked to change from fries to mashed potatoes. A little scoop served with no gravy. No salt, no pepper in sight. Price doesn't come cheap at almost RMM40 per platter (large). Somehow, the umami is gone.

I liked the Thai style fish fillet (not sure what fish was it but definitely seawater fish). The Thai sauce had a nice blend of ingredients. And lastly, we also had Midin - simple yet tasty even why just stir fried with garlic. The meat and seafood dishes were RM15 each whereas the midin was RM12 (a bit pricey for veg).

iisechewMalaysia,Quality Japanese food in Kuching,"Before heading to Kuching Airport, Michelle and I stopped by Zu Sakura Tei for a light lunch. This Japanese restaurant, which is only 5 minutes away from the airport, is a personal favourite among Kuchingites. When I first came to Kuching as a junior doctor, multiple times have I been recommended this place by colleagues & senior doctors alike. To satisfy my cravings for good Japanese food, I explored the culinary delights in Zu Sakura Tei two years ago, and have since been a patron of this eatery.For starters, the green tea served is definitely good stuff (I'm comparing this to the diluted forms of green tea served in the Sushi King chain… haha… ), always being refilled readily. My wife and I enjoy the salmon skin, which just prior to being served, is torched and has a smokey crisp taste; having this with wasabi and shoyu completes it. The Salmon Mentai Dragon Roll is a MUST. Reasonably priced & artfully presented, the texture and taste of the sushi rice is amazing. The salmon topped with fish roe is seared to perfection. Freshness is at its best. I don't know if I have found a better sushi roll in Kuching, to be honest. Other dishes like the Japanese Garlic Fried Rice and the Agedashi Tofu is done right up to my liking. Just look at the crispy skin of the tofu, and the accompanying garnishing! Another strong point of this place is how the boss, Ms Connie, is at the forefront, ensuring all patrons are served, and food is up to standard. Ms Connie gives friendly vibes and is approachable. If you are looking for good Japanese food at a reasonable price in Kuching, this is the place to go to.Show less",4.0,Reviewed 11 August 2020 ,Zu Sakuratei
iisechewMalaysia,Family favourite ‘Lui Cha’ stall ,"Anyone here ever tried Sarawak’s ‘Lui Cha’? ☘️ It’s the meanest, greenest concoction of herbs blended into a soup that’s deemed as a potion for rejuvenation for the Hakka community. Served together with Sarawak red rice, it packs a punch. Believe me, Sarawak’s version of this dish is an entire different world as compared to West Malaysia; I’ve tried Johor and KL’s version, nothing can beat the strength and bitterness of Sarawak’s Lui Cha. It is so indescribably bitter - when I first came to Kuching, in order to impress Michelle Goh Vivian’s parents, somewhat like passage of rite I dived into Lui Cha. At my first bite, I quietly exclaimed to Michelle, “Hey, I think it’s spoilt,” hoping not to catch her parent’s eyes. It was incredulously bitter. She laughed at me and said it tastes perfectly fine! With perseverance and multiple trials of this dish, I’ve now come to love it and it happens to be a must have whenever I go back to Kuching. I am also married to Michelle now hehe. This Lui Cha stall in Huo Min Cafe is a family favourite - serving perhaps the largest portion of greens for the same price as other stalls. For those who want to look younger, many of the locals here swear by this dish. — with Michelle Goh Vivian and 2 others at Huo Min Cafe (和民园).Show less",4.0,Reviewed 7 August 2020 ,Huo Min Cafe

So we havd high expectations. We had reservations, but when we arrived, they seated us smack in the entrance ( close to the kitchen counter where waiters took the food trays rom). So we requested to be moved- they moved us to the ' extension"" which was outside- where we were promptly attacked by mosquitoes. So we moved back to the same table inside. Ordered drinks, and we could have sworn there was no alcohol in their bloody Mary. There wa sno difference between my drink and which my wife ordered ( she sked for non-alcoholic one, and I found it tasted exactly as mine, which was supposed to be a regular one). The service simply sucks .When we checked about their "" Special menu for the evening"", the waitress ( who was the perfect non-friendly, sour faced , disillusioned employee of the year) said she did not know if the items came with anything else such as rice or salad. Finally we ordered, and requested that my wife who is a vegetarian, be served a garlic bread or at least two slices of bread- and she refused saying there is no bread ( There is no Bread in a restaurant !!!) . We were about the first to arrive there ( 7: 10 PM), so there were not more than 3 patrons there, but the way the waiters ran around, talking loudly, made it look like the place was crouded and they were over stressed ! When the food came, it came in intervals of 15 minutes- so the first to get served had almost finished when I got my order ( the last). By then the restaurant was half full, so we waited another 15 minutes before we got the attention of the waitress, and asked for the bill and reuested for a taxi- she said there is no way she can call a cab, as they dont have any phone numbers for that ( even tiniest restaurants we dined in Kuching had no such problems). While waiting for the Check, another lady ( who looked and acted like the owner) asked us if evrything is OK. We all shrugged, and showed our disappointment, but she never asked any more questions and walked past. When we paid the check, the change came as a big bundle of singles ( about 25 of them, along with bigger bills), and with the waitress and another person (Owner??) hovering around, watching us count it all out, and checking out how much we would tip for their wonderful attitude and adding insult to injury ( pricy dinner for a lousy year end evening). For the first time in our life, we decided they deserved NO tip - for NOSH ( No Service Here restaurant).

The bigger the table, the more pax it can sit. Vice versa. We asked for join tables. It's not rocket science.Disappointment 2: We decided on the food a day before the event, yet we were told that they will not serve the agreed fruits. Why bother to put it in the menu when you cannot deliver it? Disappointment 3: Our food was served, even without asking/clarifying with us should it be served, is it so hard to ask? The birthday gal haven't even arrive yet. Disappointment 4: Staff not helpful and attentive, we informed them to serve the cake after we finish our main meal. Alas, no one bother to serve us until I give a signal, which they blankly stared at me. Then walking to me which I told him that he can serve the cake now. Disappointment 5: At the payment counter, we wanted to use VISA Paywave for the bill, but to our terror they said they prefer PIN. What on earth just happened?!?

Unfortunately for the recent visit (June 2019), the cashier has overcharge me for the food ordered. All prices mentioned are listed on the board. My group ordered four roti kosong (plain - RM1.20 each x 3 = RM3.60) and one roti telur (with egg - RM2.20 x 1 = RM2.20) and three teh tarik (RM1.80 each x 3 = RM5.40). Total RM12.40. However, the cashier initially said RM13.40 for the total when I asked for payment. Then upon questioning why the price is wrong compare to the board, he stated that the teh tarik is now RM2.00 each instead. Therefore then he himself revised the total to RM13.00 (still 60 cents above actual price listed). I did not argue further as it's not worth my time for the 60 cents difference. My thought is if you dare to overcharge things or make up figures as you go compare to the price listed on board, you're lying and unethical in your business conduct. Therefore, this incident left a 'bad taste' and I am not going to visit this place anymore in the future. I'm writing this review as a warning to others to avoid this place unless you're ready to be possibly be cheated and lied to about how the food is charged without referencing to the listed price anymore.

"Chong LSibu, Malaysia",Disappointed,I went to this place a long time ago and it was a nice place. The food was nice the service was good and the environment was nice too.
