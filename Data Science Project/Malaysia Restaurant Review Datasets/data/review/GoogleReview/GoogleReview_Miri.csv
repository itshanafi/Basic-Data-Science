The setting of the restaurant is classy and cozy. The staff is professional and attentive. As the restaurant is located in the Kingwood Hotel, the price can be a little bit pricey than others. No booking was needed for normal dish. However, if you're interested in trying the platter then you have to book in advance. The 5 star dining experience in Miri so far.","Rated 5.0 out of 5,",Bonzer Restaurant_Kingwood Hotel,"574, Jalan Ross, Miri, Sarawak"

The place is very clean and tidy. The menu is adequate, I really fancied a steak, when I asked if they were fresh I was surprised to hear they weren't but I liked the honesty. Mind you for a frozen steak it seemed expensive. I opted for the fish and chips, asked for the price of bottled beers and decided against it. The food was good, I enjoyed it, though the grated parmesan on the fish was a bit odd. Could of done with some more vegetables or salad. Staff were very friendly and all in all a positive chilled experience.","Rated 5.0 out of 5,",Bonzer Restaurant_Kingwood Hotel,"574, Jalan Ross, Miri, Sarawak"

The pasta dishes are very good and I would consider them as one of the best, if not the best, in Miri.The local dishes are very tasty especially the Nasi Lemak Burger. What a clever idea to serve the iconic Malaysian dish as a burger with the bun made out of rice. It reminds me of the MOS burger.The price is very reasonable as it includes the tax and service charge.Compliments to the chef and everyone at Bonzer for the amazing food experience.

The eatery is very basic, the staff were very friendly, the old man could have smiled but hey. The menu offers a range of Indian style food alongside more traditional Malaysian. The chicken vindaloo is what grabbed my attention from researching the place on Maps. That was quickly ordered along with tarka dahl and garlic naan, washed down with a mango lassi. Didn't go for rice, why waste the space. The food is prepared to order, the drink was refreshing and not too thick, then after a wait of around 15 minutes, which I was pleased knowing that the food was being prepared and not just scooped out of a container. The chicken vindaloo I ordered to be spicy, it was really nice, tasty and not oily, good range of flavours, could have been a little spicier for my tastes. The dahl was awesome, nice and thick, with loads of flavours, good to see that they put in blackened dried red chillies, just how I like it. The bread too was very good, thought it looked a bit dry when I first saw it, but I was wrong, plenty of garlic and they were just right.

I didn't felt like eating but just to accompany my friends. I told the cashier (owner) I didn't want to order since he asked what should I wanted order. Immediately he asked me to leave the restaurant with a bad attitude because I'm not ordering, also saying , ""This is SOP"". There was no statement in SOP saying that customers are not allowed to come and stay without ordering food. (If I'm not wrong, as a customer, I have the right to not order among my friends if I don't feel like it) I would understand if it's your own restaurant rule that whoever doesn't order shall not have the rights to stay since we are not ordering anything, but 1) I came with a group not as an individual 2) abusing the title SOP. If it's your own restaurant rule then it is then so your own restaurant rule, NOT UNDER THE SOP RULE. There were some SOP's they weren't following either and I would not like to state it here. Additionally, they asked me to leave in a very rude matter, pointing the exit and asked me to leave, embarrassed me in front of my friends and the other customer. I, on the other hand did not felt ashamed however very very disappointed as he was bias towards my friends because they bought food and treated them very nice unlike me just accompanying my friends and not ordering food.

Hence, I tried on their Wat Tan Hor, and it was great. Many times had l attempt to look for Wat Tan Hor that had the ultimate taste similar to what my imagination could tell me (Wat Tan Hor similar like Sandakan's), and bingo! I found it at Lao Yang. Moreover, their Wheatgrass C and 3 Layer Tea taste just as good as I wanted it to be. On top of that, I came here for another time to have a try on their dim sum (alone) - I ate a lot, and it didn't disappoint me at all. From that moment, it became one of my starred eating places. Even, then environment is soothing and calming plus quite traditional looking - which I enjoyed as a solo eater traveler. On the other hand, I tried their pork chop and it was deliberately excellent to. To this day, none of the food that I ordered by instinct made me sad. I love to eat and I find happiness in eating. When my tummy is happy, my person is happy. I just visited again last night for another round of Wat Tan Hor, and Wheatgrass C, and like always, I'm satisfied and contented.

Managed to secure a small table of 2 and ordered one of the elixir, the 2 layer exquisite burger and beef flatbread. The ambient and deco of the cafe is tiptop as commented by the rest of 5 stars. But we all came here to eat and not just to enjoy the view so food is the one that degraded it to 2 stars. The elixir drinks, first on menu (forgot the name cz not worth memorising) tasted like bandung topped with 5 dried roses. Not much to describe on the taste but yea, it's below average. Next come the beef flatbread. The flatbread was nice and crunchy, but the beef still have bits of bones left on it. I don't think anyone would think the meat on flatbread having any bones so if you are reading this and wanted to try flatbread, just be careful when eating them. Last but not least the burger, also forgotten the name but it is the featured one on the menu with one layer of fried breaded patty with beef stuffing and beef patty. Not gonna lie, the plating of the burger is stunning. However, the burger is just too dry. The fried patty is dry, the grilled patty is dry as well. The aftertaste is also quite oily and not pleasant. As for the salad, I would describe it as chunks of cabbage with tasteless mayo. I really hope it is only my table that has that kind of dissapointing salad. Overall, would come to hang if friends invited but would not come on my own will unless they really look into their food quality.Ps: I think there is another review that said it already, but yeah, their toilet sink is so so special.","Rated 2.0 out of 5,",The Nest Cafe Lounge,"No A-G18, Miri Times Square, Marina Parkcity, 98000, Miri, Sarawak"

Packaging is 100/100, best one I've seen (especially the benedict).Now for the food:Pork Belly Aglio Oglio - Spaghetti was a little bland for my taste but was nice. Pork belly was the star of the meal. Though you can get far cheaper prices for pork belly of this variant in town. Price was 34.90 on Grab, not worth the price imo. 4/10.The Diablo - Expected a more crispier texture but I guess the wait made them a tad soggy. Taste was ok, am not much of a seafood person. Portion is similar to a personal pan pizza (6-8 inches, probably a bit more), quite generous with the toppings. Liked this one. Costed 34.70. 5/10.Smoked benedict - english muffins were very soggy by the time I wanted to dig in. Hoped they were more toasted. The poached egg had a particularly strong taste. Hollandaise sauce was either non-existent or was too little. Costed 25.70. Piato Bistro's is slightly cheaper and has a broader selection, recommend visit there for your eggs benedict fix. 1/10.For an average Mirian, the place has very extravagant prices with somewhat mediocre food. Heard the drinks, ambience and customer service is excellent, might try in a later future, but not too soon.","Rated 2.0 out of 5,",The Nest Cafe Lounge,"No A-G18, Miri Times Square, Marina Parkcity, 98000, Miri, Sarawak"

Unfortunately the main aspects that should keep a f&b establishment going are a bit of a let down - the food and drinks.I had an iced latte - bit on the weak side, price is fair for a coffee of that size (RM10). I savoured the avocado cheesecake (RM17.90?), the Diablo flatbread (RM29.90), and the Cuban panini. With the price tag, I expected a lot more. For the avocado cheesecake, certainly, it was light in its taste - more delicate than the usual cheesecake - instead of cheese or avocado, the mixture somehow gave the distinct impression of gelatin being the dominant taste. I can't be sure if this ingredient was used or not, it's the only word I could use to describe the experience.As for the Diablo, I was warned to not expect the usual pizza or bready texture associated with Greek, Italian or Middle Eastern cousins but rather a thin, biscuit-y and crispy texture which I quite liked. The toppings themselves smelled really good and the flavours went together quite well, until a dining partner commented that there was a pungent ""blue cheese"" smell. I didn't think that aged cheddar could taste that strong, we figured it was coming from the prawns.Cuban - The server/cashier forewarned to me that the dish would be 'salty', which I was prepared for, otherwise, what good is a pickle in a cubano without the salt? :) What I did not expect was that that was the only taste in the sandwich which was otherwise quite bland. For RM 25.90 and being notified by the server, I expected to get a salty-porky hit from the ham, umami from the cheese, and a sweet-sour pickle to contrast. The texture of the panini itself was good. The redeeming factor for that dish was the fries (dusted with parmesan?) which was not meant to be the star of the dish!I'd give The Nest another go for other usual cakes (something with chocolate), and perhaps savour a breakfast dish or their burger. For the prices attached, my expectations remain high.","Rated 2.0 out of 5,",The Nest Cafe Lounge,"No A-G18, Miri Times Square, Marina Parkcity, 98000, Miri, Sarawak"

We were the only customers at 10:30am on a Tuesday.  The Nest‚Äôs food is a western menu; not too popular in Miri at breakfast time, where most everyone wants their Kolok Mee in the morning.We started with coffees, which were strong and fresh; a bit too strong for my partner but I enjoyed my latte.My partner had the breakfast special.  The presentation was enticing, in a big nest of string potatoes, on sourdough bread, with bacon and quail eggs, which were flavorful.  The Sausage was a bit tart (assam) so my partner transferred it to my plate.I had Eggs Benedict. The Eggs Benedict was perfect, very authentic, exactly as shown in the menu.The plates were not delivered at the same time, but I don‚Äôt expect this to happen very often in Asia, unless I‚Äôm at at a 5 star hotel in Singapore.The waiter was good. The food was delivered in 15 minutes.I retuned a week later, on my way back from a long hike in Lambir National Park, hungry and thirsty, I stopped at The Nest mid-afternoon and ordered the Ultimate Burger and two Strawberry Coolers.  It was certainly the BEST BURGER I‚Äôve ever had in Miri.  The beef burger, cooked perfectly medium, was accompanied with a bbq rib patty, red cole-slaw and sweet potatoes fries.

One of the egg benedicts was a bit undercooked as it was too runny, the other was fine.

Probably it is a matter of lack of staff too. ‚Ä¶MoreThey sell good Japanese cuisine. However, during my experience today, I felt that their staffs are very irresponsible. Probably it is a matter of lack of staff too.Firstly, we ordered two very simple sushi dishes at the start of our dining but it didn‚Äôt come. Even my friends who came late and placed their order later than me got their dishes already before I got the two. One dish came after I made a request to them and the other did not come at all even after we left the table. Then we were making the payment at the cashier, she actually wanted us to bring the dish (takeaway) home. I refused it, it was unreasonable. Although they gave me some very unwilling faces, but it will be unfair to us if I accepted that offer as it is clearly their fault, I‚Äôm not bearing it for them.Secondly, we were asking for green tea throughout our meal but it just didn‚Äôt come after six attempts. We only started having it half way through our meal and it made the experience quite unpleasant.Thirdly, a less severe one is that no one came to clear the plates. They shouldn‚Äôt have charge us that much service charge because I walked to the waiters to give them out order and cleared our own plates and put them in their respective baskets/trays.In conclusion, I would not come here again if their services remain the same.

Generous portion with good price(apparently lots of 5 stars review given because of just that). However there is no greens. Main dish is served on top of mashed potato, contaminating the taste. Ordered the bbq Guinness chicken but didn't get the malt taste on it. The poached egg is more to hard boiled egg. Mashed potato still have large chunk of potato in it.

I opted for lamb Rogan Josh with tarka Dahl and garlic naan with a fresh mango lassi. The option to spice it up was taken. The meal was delicious, the meat was very tender, cooked on the bone and the Dahl was perfect as were the garlic naan, I ordered another they were that good. Service too was excellent.

It was not actually your establishment that I wanted to review, rather the branch operating out of Pujut 9. Those were the most disgusting burgers I've had in my life.That was 6 months ago.Coincidentally, I visited this branch last week (for the first time). While everything was certainly better than my initial 1-star rating, it lacks a few things that make it a 5-star experience, namely the metal poll left outside the main entrance that represents a major safety hazard, and the average tasting burgers. The fries are mostly the end bits that look like they were from the bottom of the pack.I would still say it was a decent experience as there's a good vibe, nice and clean layout, large tables, and the presentation of the food is decent. Price is good  and I'd be keen to come back to try the rice dishes and what looks to be pretty good coffee, but definitely not the burgers. Admittedly, I have yet to find a really good burger in Miri.Sorry again for the initial low rating which I have now updated to reflect this branch. However, still a lot of room for improvement in my opinion.","Rated 3.0 out of 5,",Don‚Äôs Burger Permyjaya,"Jalan astana phase 6, Bandar Baru Permyjaya, Miri, Sarawak"

Alimin Juna,"Easily the best joint if you're munching hard. Soul food has never been best represented in Miri until now.

Soul food has never been best represented in Miri until now. Though it's more towards white people soul food, that's been carefully and meticulously adjusted to the Sarawak pallette.For absolute beginners, you should definitely go for the Krispy Monyeng. But if you're hungry, go 240 Krispy, which means double patty.Still hungry? They now have rice dishes, and for those who wants to stay longer in the toilet, they have chicken skins, slathered in some sort of orange concoction which I don't dare to question.Don's burgers are simple.

Not exceptional but decent portions with a good range of local and western dishes all reasonably priced. I'd recommend the umai (local raw fish dish) for anyone a little daring.

The staff were friendly and service was prompt. The food was tasty we enjoyed a pizza here as well as some pasta which they took the meat out of to make vegetarian. We went on ladies night, Wednesday, so I was entitled to a free drink. On the chalk board it was clearly listed that mojhitos were part of the deal however when it came to pay I was told that the board wasn't up to date (only wine and beer was included now) and that its not part of ladies night. With quite a lot of explaining and defiance they deducted the mojhito off the bill and I advised they update the board to make sure the mistake doesn't happen again.","Rated 4.0 out of 5,",Chillax Cafe & Bistro,"Lot 2085, Jalan MS 1/1, Marina Square 1, Marina Parkcity, Miri, Sarawak"

Fairuzaimi Zakaria,"Most mediocre grilled cheese sandwich I ever had, and an easily-forgettable cinnamon roll. ‚Ä¶MoreMost mediocre grilled cheese sandwich I ever had, and an easily-forgettable cinnamon roll.Price: Acceptable.Cleanliness: Very good.I ordered one of their set menu which comes with: grilled cheese sandwich, blue pea lemonade, and custard tart (which as I'm typing this, I just realised they've forgotten about the custard tart). The set cost RM20, and I got an extra cinnamon roll on the side for an additional rm5.The grilled cheese sandwich came looking like it had refused getting grilled and the cook just doesn't have the heart to force the sandwich to do what it doesn't want to. The cheese used was mozzarella, with no other ingredient in the sandwich itself. It's like.. the most angelic grilled cheese sandwich (nobody want their grilled cheese to be angelic, we all want them bad).I'm not sure if they had forgotten to reheat the cinnamon roll, or have reheated it and forgot to send them before it gets cold again, but I am very sure that they had forgotten the icing. But alas when I asked the waiter if they had forgotten the icing, I was informed that the icing comes with extra cost of RM3 - which I agreed to pay, only to be later on informed that the icing that they had in stock has gone bad.Update on the custard tart: it came reheated, and taste decent. Thank God for an honorable closing to my meal here.But I'm not returning.","Rated 3.0 out of 5,",Crumb Artisan Bakery & Cafe,"D-G-13A Miri Times Square, Marina ParkCity, Miri"

Keep up the kiamsiap attitude n keep losing your loyal customers along the way. Haven't come back once ever since. Make all the excuses u want, but these words came from your own employees.Update:Not even an apology for the severe stomachache caused n even claimed I complained at the wrong shop.

I just can't sit at the same table with my three kids. I don't know much about sop but I think I'm doing the right thing. Based on this rude attitude towards customers and daring to confront customers, I will definitely not visit again unless I have no other way out next time.In addition, the bread seems to be thickly coated with butter, but it is made of low-grade and tasteless butter, which is speechless. The choice of kaya is still good.The spring rolls were delicious, but the chili sauce was very salty. The kids also complained that the hot dogs were salty. It seems the food here is flat and salty.The coffee ice tastes good, but the ice is full.To sum up, although the outside and inside design is not bad, it is not recommended because the service and food are not up to standard.(Original)""Sop sop..""

Loved the fish skins for my kerabu and the medley of raw veges are well thought out. I did  not feel like I was eating anything raw which was always going to be a challenge for me, but I knew it was healthy at the same time - two thumbs up! Prices are hefty (above RM15 per plate) but the portions are pretty big. It's also an order-at-the-counter place which is smart considering how packed they get during lunch. The only improvements I would say are needed are the service which can tend to be a bit slow eg for clearing tables even without having to take orders. Place is airconditioned - do not expect to sit around to have a chat as it gets crowded at lunch.","Rated 4.0 out of 5,",Feed Me Miri,"Lot 3528, Ground floor, Al-Bayt Square Miri 101 Commercial Centre, Jalan Miri Pujut, Miri, Sarawak"

I had the Grilled Chicken Salad and Buffalo Chicken Wings. For the salad, I would like it better if they left a bit of the skin of the chicken so I could taste the seasoning or marinade. The cook of the chicken was okay. Some parts were dry but the honey dressing on it compensated that. As for the wings, the batter was a bit on the thicker side. The flavour was decent.

I bought two Nasi Lemak with Sambal Paru, Sambal Sotong and Ayam Goreng together with Teh C Special as a drink. It has cost me around RM31. The price was reasonable. Their Nasi Lemak tastes good.

They've said that the Sambal or ""Chili Paste Sauce"" was too hot and spicy but I don't think it so. Because Sambal needs to be hot and spicy. After all, their Sambal spiciness is not that hot. I would say between it is at Level 4 between Level 1-10 spiciness. There's a variety of side dishes to choose from. This place offers dine-in and take away option as well as delivery via Foodpanda.
