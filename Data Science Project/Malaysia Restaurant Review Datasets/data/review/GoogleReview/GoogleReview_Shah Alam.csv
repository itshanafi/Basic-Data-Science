faisal husain,"This place is a hidden gem, rare to find a place where so much attention to detail has been spared by the proprietors, I kid you not, you can close your eyes and imagine yourself in the Yemen the smell of the expertly cooked lamb and the juicy chicken shish. Anyways I have tried almost everything on the menu and every dish is incredible, I will save wilting about the rice dishes, let's focus on the shish tawaooq or however it's spelt....never had chicken breast so juicy, not your dry interesting slightly soggy cardboard. Why am I bagging on about the chicken, because it's very rare to get it perfect like this, straight of the bbq, the flavour is out of this world. Don't get me started about the lamb, the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! Deeeeeeeeelicioussssss! The rice dishes are set apart from other Arab restaurants because they use premium pusa basmati rice. I honestly haven't had Yemeni malawa bread like this place, it's amazing all by itself.The best part is for premium ingredients the price is cheap to moderate, hopefully they won't put their prices up.Thank you for a wonderful experience everyone thro there.This place is a hidden gem, rare to find a place where so much attention to detail has been spared by the proprietors, I kid you not, you can close your eyes and imagine yourself in the Yemen the smell of the expertly cooked lamb and the ‚Ä¶More","Rated 5.0 out of 5,",Hadramawt Kitchen Shah Alam-Middle Eastern Restaurant,"Jalan Penguasa A U1/53A, Kawasan Perindustrian Temasya, Shah Alam, Selangor"

My first thought upon eating the warak 'aynab was ""Where have you been hiding all this time?! How come I had not heard about the place before?!"" since I personally believe it is a hidden gem and found the food to be on the same level as the higher end places in the Middle East, but with affordable prices. The rice had just the right balance of being moist, wasn't too greasy and yet was ma shaa Allaah tabarak Allaah so fragrant and flavourful. Ditto on the chicken and, especially,  the mixed grill. Regardless of chicken or meat it was tender and packed some serious flavours. Loved the cocktail as well; sweet, thick and creamy with a nice balance of mango and strawberry (I think?).

Qi Hong Wong,Ole-Ole Bali has always been one of my more favoured restaurants around. The quality of the food seems to have stayed the same over the years which is more than I can say for most establishments. Portions as always are large. I do however want to note the drinks are extremely over sweetened (in particular the Lime Barley and Es Campur). The water had a really strange almost fishy taste to it (it had what looked to be Pandan in it) which was not very palatable.Ole-Ole Bali has always been one of my more favoured restaurants around.

Sheac Yee Yap,"It used to be my favourite for mee hun kuih since I was kid, soup base was delicious and price was very affordable. Their barley cincau is very nice as well.However, ever since their son took over it somehow loses it's original taste and the noodles wasn't as smooth as it's used to be.Most importantly their customer service is really really terrible. The scenario was just a small matter, I did not wanted to add the pork liver to the soup, and only wanted pork meat. However, I did not know that their pork & liver refer to the meat and the liver separately. So upon order, I should have said only ""liver"" instead of ""pork liver"".In the end the noodle served with plain noddles without any meats. Then I tried to ask them, why is it like this in a nice way and the boss started to argue with me in a very impolite way and keep pushing it to my responsibilities that it's my fault that I ordered wrongly.

Paper thin hand peeled flour which is boiled until it has an al dente texture slightly firmer than wonton skin blanched in a soup concoction that has been a secret handed down from father to son.

Kwong Thong Goh,"I was initially quite apprehensive when I brought my family and stepped into the restaurant. We were the only patrons then (and also when we left).The menu was also quite limited (eventually was advised this was due to lack to staff), and many of the items reviewed earlier were no longer on the menu.So we ended up ordering a burger (Hawaiian) set, french fries, Aglio Olio with Teriyaki Chicken, Spaghetti Pomodoro and another pasta with 3 cheeses.My initial trepidation dissipated when the orders were served. The quality of the food was excellent, and the flavours very well balanced. We especially like the teriyaki chicken (very tender) and the spaghetti pomodoro (my missus said it reminded her of a lovely restaurant in Italy). The french fries was far better than those served at fast food outlets and one of the better ones I have had in a while.Portions are not particularly big so if you have a big appetite a second order is likely necessary. Prices are average (a bit high from a volume perspective, but duly compensated by the taste and quality).You will have to wait a bit for the food to be served as every item is supposedly prepared from scratch (it took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive) but for me it was worth the wait.A return visit is very likely for me.I was initially quite apprehensive when I brought my family and stepped into the restaurant.

The ravioli in that prawn bisque creaminess is something to die for. Highly recommended to share though! For non-creamy lovers, their aglio olio hits the spot (or you can opt for our favourite which yay they kept on their new menu; drunken spaghetti).

Nava K,"Set lunch indeed is the valid reason why I popped by with my Indian friend who is French food fancy frilly.  Cucumber juice we started off is something different. I can assure you it‚Äôs not the cucumber juice you make in your house. This one is special. Elevated with other ingredients as well for daintily punching waking you up. Nice and soothing. Sipping in, simultaneously we nibbled the bread. Must be French bread right? Can't be Indian bread in  French restaurant?Next, we tackled the Mushroom Soup and Salad. My-my! Unlike the bluffology con job canned mushroom soup, conning by the way takes place in high eat eateries too, this Mushroom Soup I strongly believe is made in La Belle Saison‚Äôs kitchen. I can vouch. Up notch delicious. Cute tiny croutons, herbs and a drizzle of olive oil atop thick, creamy and full of flavours Mushroom Soup.Equally appetizing was the Potato Mango Salad. I particularly love its tangy sweet vinaigrette, tossed alongside soft digestible potato,mango, tomato, salad leaves and croutons. So lovable. Both of these dishes polished up till super clean. Caesar Chicken Wrap, not the Caesar in ""Return Of The Planet Of The Apes"" though, teamed alongside Mashed Potato and Potato Salad was a winner for my friend. Neatly tucked with chicken pieces, veggies and some sort of creamy dressing. Taste can't be faulted, but sorry peeps, I am not a wrap person. No way. Please don‚Äô bring any wrap close to me. I will hate you. The accompanied Mashed Potato and Potato Salad I bet will always be loved by anyone?For me, the moment of truth was Oven Baked Chicken. Utterly fab. No smell, moist and super tender meat tucked beneath absolutely crispy skin. Yum! Plain tastes alright yet remarkable. I still can‚Äôt get over and done with it. Crispy Potato Skin and Garlic Mash were quite rocking as well. My friend couldn‚Äôt agree more.We then realise that dessert is not included in set lunch. Why not? I‚Äôm sure a tiny serving of French sweetness can be thrown in? French cuisine without dessert is definitely not complete. Thus, we flipped the menu to call for Crepe Banana Chocolate. What can I say? Disappointingly pin drop silence. The only food loser amongst everything we had tucked into so far. Something didn‚Äôt go right. Bottom line, we didn‚Äôt like crepe with banana slices and chocolate. What a waste to our money.Having said that, conclusively, set lunch in La Bella Saison is really worth it. And to those of you who keep harping that La Belle Saison is a hidden gem, for god sake, stop it. Sounds really corny. La Bella Saison is not hidden. Waze up and it will land in front of La Belle Saison where parking is friendly and if you bump into the owner, tell him Nava said hi.Set lunch indeed is the valid reason why I popped by with my Indian friend who is French food fancy frilly.

Shirley Wong,"Had high expectations of this place having read all the great reviews. However I left grossly disappointed after having had what was possibly the worst spaghetti carbonara so far. The pasta was so claggy that I was quite done with it by the third mouthful. The dish in itself looked pretty sad, and the only ingredient to accompany the pasta was some chicken bits. I was quite famished when I arrived at the restaurant which was why I‚Äôd decided that ordering from the set lunch would be the quickest option. Even the appetizer of garden salad was drowning in the tardy orange vinaigrette. The only saving grace from my set was the drink of the day which was a cucumber lime drink. As my date and I were the last to leave the restaurant before they close for the afternoon, the restaurant‚Äôs staff was already occupying the back tables and looked unwelcoming. I was turned off to say the least. I‚Äôm not sure I will be back to give this restaurant a second chance.

Looks like the portion was for 3 person. Haha. The lambs were juicy and tender. I love it! The rice a bit dry, but it comes with soup and sambal.Chicken Kebab : nice to eat. Very soft and tender, the taste was good. But i was unable to finish it due to the Mandy's portion was so huge.Cheese Kunafa : im not into kunafa usually. But this is my wife's review. The Kunafa was nice, but a bit milky, taste like a sweetener. But she love the cheese all over the Kunafa.A bit bad review: the staff was not so friendly. Need to improve on this. I asked the staff to pack my lemon juice, as i need to rush for another place. One of the staff took my juice and bring it somewhere. After 5 minutes, i still didnt get my juice back. I go to the kitchen and ask one of the staff, but the staff keep on pushing me to go to another counter by saying ""air order sana"" and repeat it a few times eventhough i still not finish my talking.Otherwise, the foods all good.

During Ramadhan, it might be hard to find a parking space, so you'd have to come early.The menu is tasty and we enjoyed our iftar. Of course, if you're not used to middle eastern food, you'd might need some time adapting, but they are delicious in their own way. I think this restaurant is Yemeni.. this is important because the way they cook a dish differs in each country.Prayer space is available, it's a makeshift space, so if you're not comfortable with that, there's a mosque nearby.Our food came a bit slow because of the crowd, the waiter missed two dishes so we had to wait a little bit longer, but to me it's fine.Go on and give the place a try!If you want to 'fefeeling' having dinner in a castle, this would be just the right place.

Senja give the impression of local dishes and Malay specialities, much like the Serai or Santai restaurants..... however Senja excels in authentic Italian cuisine.

OurSage Memoirs,"Probably this reataurant is really into its Lala Soup and not the fried noodles. However, to place the ""Hokkein Fried Noodles"" as one of its signature, its is hype up.The Hokkein fried noodles really can't make the cut! The crunchy pork lard (must have ingredient) is just not crunchy at all, and in fact its a distraction to the whole dish. The overall taste is sweetish (probably this is what Klang flavour is and i should not impose an opinion on this), but just lack the X-Factor oomph one gets when savouring ""Fried Hokkein Noodles"". The accompanying sambal is actually a savior for me to finish my noodles, but to opine in the sambal on its own, its just standard. Nothing to shout about. However, at RM7 per pax, its way much cheaper than the famous names like Ah Wa or Damansara Uptown or Sentul Ah Yap.The Tapioca Flour Noodles, which is not listed as favourite, is way better than the Hokkein Fried Noodle. The opinion here is that its way better in comparison to the hokkein mee, but on its own, the verdict is that its ok.

It seems that having at least a group of 5 above would be ideal for them.When the boss made the order, we mentioned that we were first time and seek for some recommendations. The boss did recommend us some dishes BUT we were not aware of the serving size. Indeed, the boss ordered BIG portion for only two of us.After another hour of waiting, our food was finally here. We were SHOCKED after seeing the portion. We felt that the boss is kinda IRRESPONSIBLE as we think he should notice us on that. AND if you knew that we came in two pax, you shouldnt order BIG portion size for us. I am kinda disappointment with them.For me, they should have enough manpower in the kitchen to prepare the food since you know that there would have LONG queue waiting.So, I am not gonna come again!!!Worst service and food is not worth to be waited.We came an hour earlier before the shop and we got no. 8.

Roveen Cheong,"Reached at 5.45pm. Waited around 15 minutes for a table as the restaurant was already full packed. The queue began to steadily build up behind us after we arrived.Sat down and ordered immediately, we ordered everything on their signature list (out of the 2 prawns we chose the mantis prawn)....but to cook 2 plates of noodles, 1 plate of lala, 1 plate of mantis prawns and 1 plate of what they called three kingdoms, took them well over an hour, and they came at different times. We were positively starving so I had to forgo taking pictures at all.. we just dug in.Now on to the food itself, the signature lala was good. They had sufficient ginger, chillies and wine to cover up the seafood smell. The cereal mantis prawn was over fried. So much so that I wouldn't have guessed its mantis prawn of you didn't tell me what I was eating. The hokkien noodle tasted just like any other hokkien noodle from other restaurants. The moonlight noodles were not good and none of us liked it. My mom even thought the noodles were a lil too salty. The three kingdoms, consisted of fish fillets, prawns and cuttlefish, and it didnt feel worth the wait to us. In fact, this was probably the worst out of the 5 dishes. The cuttlefish and prawns were bland and tasteless and only the fish tasted ok. The stench of seafood was overpowering in this dish. They DID NOT do a good job of covering it up.Overall, if you just wanna try the food I'd say you can try it out once, but make sure you have ample time on your hands before you even consider going here. My own verdict is that the food was NOT worth the long wait. The only thing I thought was good was the lala, but, that's just my opinion.Reached at 5.45pm.

Ridiculously long waiting times for food and u dont get served food together, u have to wait in between dishes while u sit there looking stupid. Number 2. The food is Bad. And i mean BBBAAAADDDD... like everything is a miss. 3 kingdoms dish more like 3 waring kingdoms cause thats the dish a cluster dump. Mantisprawn nestum... Wheres the mantis prawn? Its just fried batter from how overly fried it was burried under a mountain of nestum. Lala? I might as well have a spicy vodka, same taste, less chewing. Noodles plain noodles no actual ingredients in there.Number 3 price, for that food in number 2? No thank you. There are better places to spend that kind of money.Number 4, atmosphere. One way to describe it, Fish Monger Auction Market! It is noisy and very uncomfortable with tables screaming left and right.Number 5, service and inconvenience, the service is bad and very slow, payment methods are inconvenient, they use touch n go pay but they don't have proper electronic system to make payment a smooth transaction. Its a hastle so just bring cash.So overall why would u come here ever? Idk i wouldnt.

Chek Yan Ching,Been here several times with my friends. This restaurant is small and there's a lot of people queuing. The restaurant offered a lot of seats with table outside and arranged it alongside the restaurant.The foods here popular because of it's freshness of seafood. The seafood is really fresh. The time taken to prepared all of dishes is not too long and i'm really satisfied with the presentation. The texture and mixture is well-balanced with big portion. Make it enough for 3-4 packs.Price isn't too expensive but not too cheap. Affordable and worth money when the qualities of foods here are magnificent. Service her is quite slow but they staffs are professional. I had a great experience here though.

Quite expected because people say that you have to wait for long time. The clams are really meaty and the soup is quite spicy and you can definitely taste the alcohol taste. There is only small or big - two sizes only. I think small one is enough for two people only if you really like clams. However when we come out there was already a long queue.

You must wait for a long time (make sure you take a number from the boss) just to get a place to sit down and proceed to wait for another 2 hours (after ordering) just to enjoy their delicious food. This restaurant does not do reservation. They operate by first come first serve basic.2. Great! Now you decided to wait like everyone else does. Make sure you came prepared with powerbank. You need some sort of entertainment to keep yourself busy.3. Travel in group would be wise.4. Please order their order dishes as well such as fried rice, chah kueh teow and their vegetables dishes. It's really delicious.5. Order tea better than soft drinks.BTW. Don't park your car too far from the restaurant.
